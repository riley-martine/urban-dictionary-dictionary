	·	As early as 3000 BC, a system of [irrigation] began in Persia called the qanat.  
	·	Qanats are underground [tunnels], with a [canal] in the floor of the tunnel, which carries water.  
	·	At regular intervals, well-like openings extend from the surface to the tunnel floor, and it is through these openings that the tunnels were built and through which they are maintained.  
	·	The underground nature of the canal reduces [evaporation] in the hot and windy desert, and allows 22,000 qanats to operate in Iran even today. 
	·	Qanats originate in [highlands], with a mother shaft as deep as 400 metres, and the tunnel floor [slopes] at a moderate angle toward its destination, which can be up to 160 kilometres away. 
	·	The difference between the qanat and a surface canal is that the qanat can get water from an underground [aquifer], so a surface river or stream is not needed.  
	·	Since it travels at a slope independent of the surface features, it can go in a straight line.  The water carrying canal in qanats were usually lined with stone or tile to reduce water loss.  
	·	The control of water was a key issue to Persian agriculture, and documents demonstrated that Darius and [Xerxes] authorising the mass construction of qanats at Manâ[wir] in Egypt in an effort to increase agricultural production.

Trump was being plotted against by a top-secret Satan-worshipping cabal of cannibalistic pedophiles running a child sex trafficking ring during his time in the office.

The [devolution] of Molecular Biology into 8th grade-level chemistry set bullshit has been largely driven by the use of high profile attention grabbing buzzwords such as "[genome]" and "proteome" which send government grant-bestowing organizations into a drooling frenzy like fatties at an all you can eat steakhouse. Individual [assmonkeys] with the highest profile institutions and best buzzwords are thereby left with millions of dollars a year and very little talent to spend it on. They hire a bunch of kids to use these gay little Qiagen kits to do their enormous projects, and are left with more data than they would ever be able to review themselves. If there were a golden needle in their crappy [haystacks], such assmonkeys would never find it in a million years. So they submit their piles of shit to public databases, and expect all of us who didn't get millions of dollars to sort through thier shit and find gold.

QQ
	(2008-08-02 +10368/-1750)
	Contrary to popular belief, QQ is not a set of crying eyes. It actually originated with the advent of [Warcraft II]. On battlenet, you could press [ALT+Q+Q] to immediately exit the match and program. Thus the term "QQ" was to tell people to just quit because they are unskilled. The term later developed and [lost it's] origin and is usually mistaken as crying eyes. 
	
	In contemporary gamer culture, QQ has become the mainstream emoticon for crying eyes, though it is still often used in it's traditional sense. 
		Example: "[Shut up] or QQ!"
		"[Why don't you] QQ, [noob]?"

	(2009-01-05 +3363/-900)
	Originally started in Warcraft, where [Alt+QQ] is a [hotkey] to quiting the game. 
	
	When someone bitches or whines everyone would say 'QQ', telling them to quit the game because they suck so much. 
	
	It often confuses people into thinking that it means, "[Cry more] noob", but this is totally incorrect. The fact that 'QQ' looks like a pair of teary eyes is just a mere coincidence. 
		Example: "[Quit] [bitching]. Just QQ [already]."

	(2006-03-22 +3402/-4502)
	Literally, QQ is a set of crying eyes. However, given its usual context in [online games], it is usually [assumed] to mean "[Cry more] noob."
		Example: LOL, are you still [whining] about [how you] got [owned]? QQ!!!!!111111111111

	(2011-05-07 +625/-796)
	basically chinese [msn], it has [a penguin] [logo] and random games
		Example: hey [go on] QQ [tonight] i'll be [online]

	(2013-05-07 +243/-329)
	For modern English speakers, QQ can be used in various ways. It is usually synonimous with crying, or whining:
	- It can be used as a complete response dismissively. "Stop whining and leave." -> "QQ"
	- It can be used mockingly. "Cry/Whine more" -> "QQ more."
	- It can be used as an emote to summarize [whimpering] or whining. "I hate this. [T-T]" -> "I hate this. QQ"
	
	For English speakers who are out of touch with modern culture (either too old, too FOB, or too noob to know better), QQ is used as abbr of "[Quick Question]."
	
	For people from China, QQ is a commonly known instant messaging service, similar to AIM and MSN.
		Example: [Noob]: "Hey man! QQ...!"
		Man: "Go QQ to your mom. I don't want to hear it."
		Noob: "Huh? What...?"
		Man: "QQ [NOOB]"
		Noob: "I just want to know your QQ..."
		Man: "[Oh ok]. It's chinamanbull2k. Don't [message me] unless it's important."
		Noob: "Oh, but I..."
		Man interrupts "QQ more."

	(2006-04-03 +978/-1498)
	QQ is sometimes used on the Internet as an abbreviation for crying; it is [supposedly] visually similar to two [big eyes] with tears at the bottom. For further reading, see [emoticon].
		Example: Cheater_spoted : Why did you [ban me] ! I do not cheat !
		Admin : [Anti-cheat] noticed me you do
		Cheater_spoted : I dont cheat ! plzz !
		Cheater_spoted : I DONT !!

		Example: "[Jeez] man, [quit] [QQing]!"

	(2006-10-01 +361/-540)
	[Tencent] QQ, generally referred to as QQ, is the most popular free instant messaging computer program in [Mainland] China. The original name of QQ was OICQ (Open [ICQ]) when it was initially developed by Tencent Inc. in February 1999. However, because of the possible trademark [infringement] with another popular instant messenger (ICQ), and also the fact that neither the program nor the protocol is considered "open", Tencent changed its name to QQ.
	
	The [lastest] version of QQ is QQ2006, while there are several other verions operational at the same time. Like ICQ, QQ members are identified by unique numerical QQ numbers.
	
	Although used mainly in Mainland China, QQ also finds its popularity in South Africa and there are already servers established in SA too.
		Example: (In some [Chinese] [chatrooms], these [lines] may be seen frequently) 'Can you give me your QQ number?'/'Can I have your QQ number?'

	(2005-05-19 +50/-18)
	A handy formula easily memorized by repetition. It is used in many instances, such as trying to find the roots of an equation, or solving an equation that will not factor with integers.
	
	To solve using the Quadratic Formula:
	
	In any equation
	
	ax^2+bx+c,
	
	The roots can be found by substituting into:
	
	-b(+,-)[sqrt]([b^2-4ac])/2a
	
	OR
	
	Negative "B" plus or minus the square root of "B" squared minus 4(a)(c), all [divided by 2](a).

		Example: To solve using the Quadratic Formula:
		
		In any equation
		
		ax^2+bx+c,
		
		The roots can be found by substituting into:
		
		-b(+,-)[sqrt]([b^2-4ac])/2a
		
		OR
		
		Negative "B" plus or minus the square root of "B" squared minus 4(a)(c), all [divided by 2](a).
		
		
		EX:
		
		Hm..
		
		10x^2+13X-5
		
		-13(+,-)sqrt(169+200)/20
		>_>
		In other words, by substituting the numbers in, you get 13(+,-)sqrt(369)/20.
		
		As you may or may not have guessed, this gives you a very nasty number, which should be approximated and rounded to the nearest thousandth.

	Quakerism originated in mid-17th century England, originally as a break-away branch of [Puritanism]. George Fox (1624-1691), an English preacher, founded the Society of Friends, whose open structure reflects his aversion to church hierarchy and titles. Fox held that the “Inner Light,” the inspiring [presence of God] in each person, stands above Scripture and creed. This belief resonates through Quakerism despite a fairly wide variety of practices.
	 Quaker beliefs include the emphasis on plain speech and dress; opposition to slavery and war; and the refusal to swear oaths, which [Quakers] believe undermine the daily mandate for truth-telling. Many early feminists and abolitionists were Quakers, and a strong social ethic continues to [pervade] the work of the American Friends Service Committee, which shared the Nobel Peace Prize in 1947.
	
	Quakers, who often met persecution for their beliefs, have also been champions of [religious freedom]. English Quaker William Penn founded Pennsylvania as a "holy experiment," a refuge for Quakers and other religious minorities.
	Quaker congregations are called meetings, which range from structured services led by ministers to open sessions where participants speak when inspired by their own Inner Light. Major Quaker umbrella organizations are the Friends General Conference of Philadelphia and Friends United Meeting, based in Richmond, [Ind].

	Bio:
	A powerful sorcerer who -with the asistance of his former boss and ruler of [Netherrealm], Shinnok- defeated Satan and lead his lord, [Shinnok], to victory over the Devil.
	
	Quan Chi outsmarted Netherreal lord Shinnok by giving him a fake powerful amulet. Wisely, Quan Chi remain with the real amulet and at the right time destroyed Shinnok.
	
	After betraying his "boss", Quan Chi reveled to Scorpion -A evil warrior spectre- that it was indeed him -and not his long time rival Sub-Zero- the one who slay his family.
	The mighty sorcerer atempt to send [the spectre] to Netherrealm, but just before Scorpion was transported there, he grabed Quan Chi and soon both were transported to the demonic realm.
	
	In Netherrealm, Quan Chi was able to scape [Scorpion's] rage and make a pact with two [Onis] -Moloch and Drahmin- to serve the sorcerer as bodyguards to protect him from the ruthless Scorpion.
	
	After escaping Netherrealm -with an acient portal activated by [Quan Chi's] amulet- with the asistance of [Drahmin] and [Moloch] -Who held back Scorpion from finishing Quan Chi-, Quan Chi, unknownly, found himself in a acient tomb who [holded] for hundreds of years the [mummify] army of the former Outworld ruler, Onaga. Better known as the Dragon King.
	
	After making such a discovery, Quan Chi found later a dead-to-be sorcerer, [Shang Tsung].
	Quan Chi give Shang Tsung enough power to stand and then walked away from [Tsung].
	
	In Outworld, Quan Chi regrouped with the two [onis] after they escaped Scorpion's sight back at Netherrealm. Shang Tsung apeared at the [sceen] to make the sorcerer who help him and offer he could not refeuse.
	Shang Tsung offered Quan Chi an alliance to put Earth real, Outworld and all the other realm to their knees.
	
	Quan Chi loved the idea knowing that with [Shang Tsung's] power he could revive the mummified army of the Dragon King.
	
	The Deadly Alliance was born.
	
	The almighty Deadly Alliance was able to finish the only two being who could stop them...[Shao] Khan and [Liu Kang].
	The first to taste the Deadly [Alliance's] rath was the Emperor of Outworld, Shao Khan. Then was the Mortal Kombat champion, Liu Kang.
	Quan Chi and Shang Tsung kill both of them.
	
	Then, Quan Chi and Shang Tsung's alliance became a threat to all realms.
	
	All of Earth [Realm's] warriors die in their attempt to stop the evil alliance.
	Raiden was in the need to go against the Elder God's wishes -of not interfier in the tournament- and alone challenge his two nemesis, the two sorcerers, the Deadly Alliance.
	Even though, Raiden pull up a great fight, it wasn't enough against the two sorcerers' might and the [Thunder God] was soon defeated.
	
	The Deadly Alliance was unstopable. Only one thing was able to tear apart the alliance and that was...the two sorcerers themselfs. When the two sorcerers [begain] to think the worst of eachother, they challenge oneanother...the successful Deadly Alliance was history.
	
	Quan Chi win the fight against his former partner Shang Tsung.
	The Dragon King returned to Outworld in search of Quan Chi's amulet. Quan Chi alied once more with Shang Tsung and to the surprise of all, Raiden join them to take on the former Outworld Emperor Onaga.

	Since then, the fact of Quan Chi being alive or dead is unknown.
	
	PS: Quan Chi has been able to manipulate great warriors like Scorpion and Sub-Zero, great evil like Shinnok, Moloch, Drahmin and Shang Tsung, and even the good of goods, the God of Thunder Raiden.
	Quan Chi as headline two [MK games] in [MK4] along with Shinnok and MK:DA along with Shang Tsung.

Quandale Dingle
	(2022-03-22 +347/-28)
	A Quandale Dingle is an advanced technique employed at the high school level of football in which a player of below average height but above average weight for a given position is given the football usually as part of a larger [trick play]. It is often employed in desperate game situations where the chances of winning are slim. [The move] was named after one of the greatest high school offensive guards of all time, Quandale Dingle, but its use in game scenarios is highly controversial as its overall effectiveness depends almost entirely on the motivation of the player with the ball. It has also lead to some [high-profile] career ending injuries, which is why its use has not been adopted at the college or NFL levels.
		Example: [Football Player] 1: (Looks to the [sidelines]) Oh no.
		Football Player 2: What's wrong? What's [the play] call?
		Football Player 1: Coach is calling for a Quandale Dingle.
		Football Player 2: God be with us.

	Strictly speaking "Quandar" is an adjective used to describe a feeling, state, emotion, or un-godly sex act arising out of the [trials and tribulations] of living in a [post 9/11] [enviornment]. As well, "Quandar" can be used in terms of tough parenting in direct relation to 9/11 and it's aftermath. One should be carefull when interjecting "Quandar" into casual conversation - being an emotionally charged term - using it lightly can have unforseen repercussions.
	
		Example: Ever since 9/11 the band [South Paw] have catered to an un-American, terrorist sympathising, communist tinged fan base, through lyrics that are definitely rooted in Quandar.
		
		Ever since the towers fell, Tim and Grace have been caught multiple times engaging in some pretty untastefull sex acts. Alex and I are starting to think it is in direct correlation to [post 9/11] stress and therefore can be considered Quandar in orgin.

Quantum Leap
	(2004-01-25 +121/-21)
	Theorizing that one could time travel within his own lifetime, Doctor Sam [Beckett] led an elite group of scientists into the desert to develop a top secret project known as "Quantum Leap."
	 
	Pressured to prove his theories or lose funding, Dr. Beckett prematurely stepped into the Project [Accelerator], and vanished...... 
	He awoke to find himself trapped in the past, suffering from partial amnesia and facing a mirror image that was not his own.
	 
	Fortunately, contact with his own time was maintained through [brain wave] transmissions with Al, the Project Observer who appeared in the form of a [hologram] that only Dr. Beckett can see and hear.
	 
	Trapped in the past, Dr. Beckett finds himself leaping from life to life, putting things right that once went wrong, and hoping each time that his next leap will be the leap home..........
		Example: You know, maybe this [quantum leaping] isn't such a bad deal after all.  Getting a chance to [put things right], to make the world a better place - who knows what I can accomplish before I'm done.
		-- Sam [Beckett], "Genesis"

	(2006-03-21 +27/-17)
	When you find yourself in the middle of a situation where you have no idea what is going on, but everyone else around you assumes you do.
	
	The term is a reference to the TV show where the lead character is trapped in time and travels therein by [leaping] into the body of someone in the past, but having no idea who he is or why he is there. In order to leave the body, the lead character must figure out what "situation/conflict" must be [resolved] or wrong must be righted by [the host] body. The people around him assume he is the person whose body he occupies, so anything he does, the people around him think it is the host body doing it.
		Example: "I just [quantum] leaped into a phone conversation with [Karen]. She started talking to me about something that she thought I already knew, but I had [no idea] what she was talking about."

	(2006-06-03 +46/-13)
	A physics term describing the movement of an [electron] [withing] an atom from one energy state to another without passing through any [intermediate] levels.  It was adopted into popular slang to refer to a sudden advance (especially in science or technology) that seems much more rapid than the normal evolution in that field.  The term may also denote sudden, positive social shifts.
		Example: Leslie Iwerks produced the first synchronized-sound cartoon, "[Steamboat Willie]," which represented a quantum leap forward in animation technology. 
		
		The [Gutenberg press], an invention featuring [moveable] type, represented a quantum leap forward for people in the 15th century.

Quantum Nimbus
	(2019-12-06 +472/-0)
	An uncommon, [aberrant] atmospheric condition wherein multiple opposing jet streams violently converge to form colossal, hydronautic vapor columns as a result of haphazardly fluctuating [climatic] temperatures, intense friction and a microcosmic, atomization of subterfuged kinetic energy. In especially unique and volatile environmental circumstances, extreme barometric density builds and induces a tourbillion-like vacuuming effect, whereby coagulating particles accumulate into a voluminous mass, temporarily opening a 'quantum' realm where cosmic physical properties emanate translucent, [paralytic] neuromuscular macro-waves.
		Example: 1 {Curious Observer A} - "Dude, look at that incredible cloud formation over the Superstition mountains!" {Curious Observer B} - "Dude, thats a freaking 'Quantum [Nimbus]!'"
		
		2. {[Meteorologist] broadcasting to audience} - "We've got some breaking, urgent news for you right now, so please listen closely, then take shelter immediatley if you are anywhere in the vicinity of the [east valley]. If you take a look at the weather map, right here, you will notice this unusual, columnar cloud structure, which, miraculously enough is the first observable evidence of a 'Quantum Nimbus' folks! Yes, you heard right, 'Quantum Nimbus'; capable of unleashing interminal cosmic destruction, peril, paralysis and the immediate extrication of human beings from the surface of the earth into an alternate quantum metaphysical realm, forever!"

Quantum of Solace
	(2009-01-30 +189/-26)
	- The amount of comfort.  All love and friendship is based in the end on that. When the [quantum of solace] stands at zero, you've got to get away to save yourself.  From [Ian Fleming's] short story of the same name in the Bond collection [For Your Eyes Only].
		Example: [The Governor] [paused] and looked reflectively over at Bond. He said: "You're not married, but I think it's the same with all relationships between a man and a woman. They can survive anything so long as some kind of basic humanity exists between the two people. When all kindness has gone, when one person obviously and sincerely doesn't care if the other is alive or dead, then it's just no good. That particular insult to the ego - worse, to the instinct of self-preservation - can never be forgiven. I've noticed this in hundreds of marriages. I've seen [flagrant] infidelitiespatched up, I've seen crimes and even murder forgiven by the other party, let alone bankruptcy and every other form of social crime. [Incurable disease], blindness, disaster - all these can be overcome. But never the death of common humanity in one of the partners. I've thought about this and I've invented a rather high-sounding title for this basic factor in human relations. I have called it the Law of the Quantum of Solace."

Quantum Sex
	(2011-01-14 +64/-12)
	A spiritually uplifting sexual act celebrating Cosmic Unity, generally believed to be in higher-dimensional resonance with the Big Bang (a.k.a. the Primordial [Sploog]). Thanks to this Divine Resonance, an act of [quantum sex] (according to some very odd folks) may serve as a [re-enactment] of the original Divine Union or, as some might say “the God in me slapping bellies with the Goddess in you” – which, coincidentally, is thought by some analysts to be the linguistic origins of the [breathy] rhythmic phrase “Oh God! Oh God! Oh God!”
	
	Some philosophers believe that since the Milky Way Galaxy is, in fact, composed of [the Whoopie] Sauce created in the Big Bang, and since all human beings are inhabitants thereof, it follows that human beings are, indeed, micro-manifestations of the Grand Whoopie itself, thereby lending scientific credence to the claim that quantum sex can provide important insights into the qualitative nature of the cosmological Big Bang. Other philosophers (and a majority of scientists) respond by carefully suggesting that the aforementioned philosophers "should shut their [fruckin'] pieholes.”
		Example: The phrase “[quantum sex]” appears to have originated in a ponderously unfathomable internet article called, oddly enough, “[Quantum Sex]” written by the ever-popular philosopher/sexual freedom advocate, [Gaylen] Moore, who is widely known for his claim that physics experiments are best performed under the influence of fully engorged [naughty parts].

quark
	(2011-08-27 +61/-4)
	a quark is a [fundemental] constituant of matter
	Observed in 1968 through deep elastic [scatter]
	We found that protons aren't as simple as we thought
	We thought they were solid particles but they are not
	Protons in fact are made up of three separate pieces
	It just gets more confusing as our knowledge increases
	But that is what a quark is; It's a piece of a [proton]
	And they also make up other things including the [neutron]
	And with leptons and bosons, unless something's [amiss],
	They make up everything that we can see and that we know exists
	Things made up of quarks including protons and neutrons
	Are [composite] particles that physicists call hadrons
	Many types of hadrons are theoretically described,
	But most exist for only very brief amounts of time
	Quarks have electric charge, color charge, mass and spin,
	And having color charge means they exist solely inside of
	Other kinds of particles and cannot exist alone
	Which is why quarks have never been studied on their own
	Quarks can join together in two different ways,
	Baryons and Mesons, but most instantly decay
	If a particle has three quarks, then it's a [baryon],
	And if there's one quark and and anti-quark, then it is a [meson]
		Example: Man did you hear that [Hank Green] song about quarks?
		
		Strange Charm? Yeah! It totally got me into [atoms] [and stuff]!

		Example: "Three quarks for Muster Mark!
		Sure he has not got much of a bark

quarter life crisis
	(2005-03-06 +792/-109)
	Usually occurs sometime in your twenties, a few years out of school and still feel as though you're waiting for you're life to begin.
	
	For most people it will be arround [twenty five years] of age ([give or take] a year or two) as this tends to be when you're way of thinking is starting to change beyond that of a high school or college student. Most people realise they've reached this age if they talk to teens online and realise their way of thinking/talking/interacting etc is considerably diffrent and/or they're starting to refer to teens as 'kids'.
	
	It's an age where a lot people start developing a more realistic outlook in life and start feeling that if they haven't accomplished certain things in life they thought they would by then that they may never (Even though this isn't true and they still have a long time to attain their goals and dreams). 
	
	This tends to be the age where regets about decitions made in High School, College etc start becomming more [appart]. The classes one didn't take, or could have tried harder in, the teams one didn't try out for, and wished they had and so forth can sometimes cause a lot of regret and even resentment of those that are doing things one wishes they'd done.
	
	Some people will respond to a quarter life crisis by rushing into various [landmark] type goals in life (ie, getting married, moving out from your parents house, getting your first house, getting your first real job, having kids). 
	
	This could be because their friends have accomplished one or more of these things and they're worried their falling behind them. 
	
	It may also be because they're afraid that if they don't accomplish these things by the time their 28 or so, they may never.
	
	Others respond to it by growing depressed and [blamming] others for their pervieved failures in life.
	
	People tend to move beyond this life crisis when they realise that, a lot of people feel the same way and/or are in the exact same position, so they have plently of company ([misery loves company]) and/or start to realise that perhaps some of their [hopes and dreams] were a tad bit unrealistic and that they're just getting a [reality check]. Once one realises that life [hasen't] neccessarily let them down and that their hopes and dreams were just that, hopes and dreams, but the reality has simply granted them a more down to Earth/realistic life, they'll accept it and hopefully be happy for what they have and stop [lamenting] over what they never could realistically have achieved in life.
		Example: Person1: What's wrong man?
		
		Person2: Sorry, I'm just kinda depressed. I'm [26] years old yet I feel like I should have been way more then I am [by now].
		
		Person1: [I hear ya] man, welcome to your quarter life crisis.

Queefpocalypse
	(2009-12-05 +85/-26)
	Complete and [total devastation] caused by an almighty queef.
	
	A [Queefpocalypse] occurs when one's bush is [in a rage] and catches on fire and that person has a massive queef which shoots the raging bush as a massive fireball towards space. Once it is about to break through the atmosphere, it is pulled back down like a meteor due to earth's gravity. Because of the density of a bush on fire, it accelerates faster than anything else in existence and crashes into the earth, exploding into a toxic gas. It kills noone immediately - unless it lands directly on someone - but the toxic gas envelops the world and causes everyone to queef. The queef provoking quality of the gas is so strong that guys will queef and their penises will [shoot off], creating a vagina from which they will now constantly expel queefs. The superpowered queefs now begin to cause the violent ejaculation of all internal organs through the vagina. Every living organism on the planet will eventually die. Not even cockroaches can survive a queefpocalyspe.
	
	Many scientists believe that a minor [queefpocalypse] caused the extinction of the dinosaurs. Scientists [theorize] that the dinosaurs were very succeptable to raging bushes and therefore were ticking timebombs to [envoke] a queefpocalypse. They also speculate on a weakened resistance against queefs due to their [RBS] (raging bush syndrome). This is why only the dinosaurs were killed in this queefpocalypse.
		Example: "MARK, HOLD IN YOUR FUCKING QUEEFS UNTIL YOU GET TO THE SAFE RELEASE CHAMBER!!"
		
		"Oops I queefed"
		
		"Sorry guys, I [let one] [silp]. Lucky my bush wasn't raging."

queen amidala
	(2005-05-11 +86/-48)
	A character within Star Wars played by the beautiful Natalie Portman.
	
	Character Background:
	
	Born Padmé Naberrie, [Queen Amidala] was the formal name of the royal leader of [Naboo]. As a child, Amidala was prodigiously talented and extremely well educated. She had long been interested in public service, volunteering in the Refugee Relief Movement in her youth. Her efforts helped in the Shadda-Bi-Boran exodus. At the age of eight, she joined the Apprentice Legislature and became an Apprentice [Legislator] at age 11. By 14, she was elected Queen of Naboo. 
	During the Trade Federation siege of Naboo, the scheming Neimoidians tried to force the strong-willed she to sign a treaty that would legitimize a brazenly illegal occupation. She refused, and was sentenced to a prison camp. En route to incarceration, Amidala was freed by Jedi ambassadors, who took the Queen and part of her [retinue] to [Coruscant], to plead her case before the Senate with the help of [Naboo's] galactic representative, Senator [Palpatine]. 
	
	On Coruscant, she learned of the inefficiencies of [galactic politics], watching as Trade Federation political maneuvering stalemated her plea. Following advice from Senator Palpatine, she called for a [Vote of No Confidence] in [Supreme Chancellor] Valorum. 
	
	Fed up with the Senate, she returned to Naboo. She requested aid from the native Gungans in freeing her captured capital. During the Battle of Naboo, Amidala infiltrated her own palace, and forced Neimoidian [Viceroy] [Nute Gunray] to end the occupation. The cowardly Neimoidians, having their armies defeated, capitulated and freedom was brought back to Naboo. 
	
	While Queen Amidala was the ruler of Naboo she had a large staff of advisors and aides that handled the day-to-day affairs. [Sio] Bibble, for instance, was Naboo's governor. Captain Panaka was Amidala's loyal bodyguard and head of security. Ric Olié was the pilot of the Queen's gleaming Royal Starship and leader of Bravo Flight. 
	
	Perhaps most important in Amidala's entourage were her five handmaidens. [Sach]é, Yané, Rabé, Sabé and Eirtaé not only helped the Queen with her intricate gowns, hairstyles and make-up, but they were also trained in self-defense. When in danger, she disguised herself as one of her handmaidens, and adopted her less formal name of Padmé. When disguised as Padmé, Sabé assumed the role of Queen in her place. 
	
	When her terms ended, Amidala was constitutionally obligated to step down as Queen, though the public would have easily backed an amendment allowing her to serve longer. Though she had every right to retire and concentrate on her personal life, she continued to be passionate about public service. At the request of the new Naboo monarch, Queen Jamillia, she served as Senator of Naboo, taking the position once occupied by Palpatine. In a galaxy undergoing tumultuous changes, her outspoken nature shone as a beacon of reason and rationality in an increasingly fragmented Senate. 
	
	
	With the rise of a [Separatist] movement that threatened the stability of the Republic, Amidala was one of the few [championing] a peaceful resolution to the crisis. [Alarmist] Senators tried to create a military force to protect the Republic, but she led the opposition against the Military Creation Act. She believed such a measure would inevitably lead to hostilities against the Separatists. 
	
	On the day of the Military Creation Act vote, Amidala's starship was attacked upon arriving at Coruscant. Seven people, including her decoy Cordé, died in the explosion. Though some suspected that disgruntled spice miners from [the moons] of Naboo were the culprits, Amidala believed that it was actually [Count Dooku], leader of the Separatists, behind the attack. In truth, it was an old enemy, Nute Gunray, who was behind [the bounty] hunters hired to finally silence the young woman from Naboo, though that would go undiscovered for some time. 
	
	At the [behest] of Supreme Chancellor Palpatine, Amidala was placed under the protection of the Jedi Knights. Amidala was once again reunited with Obi-Wan Kenobi and his apprentice [Anakin] Skywalker, whom she had not seen in a decade. A second [assassination attempt] by the bounty hunter Zam Wesell revealed just how gravely in danger Amidala was. 
	
	Anakin was to escort her to Naboo, where she would be [sequestered] while the Jedi investigated the attacks against her. In moments of quiet solitude against the beautiful landscape of Naboo's Lake Country, she and Anakin bonded, rekindling an affectionate friendship that had been interrupted ten years ago, and falling into a deeper love. 
	
	It was a love forbidden to both. As per the tenets of [the Jedi Code], Anakin could not enter into a romantic relationship, and Padmé needed to focus on her career. Despite their strong feelings, it was Padmé who remained the realist, rebuffing [Anakin's] overtures while attempting to still her own heart. 
	
	Anakin's love for her was not all that was troubling him. He suffered from terrible nightmares of his mother in danger. When he could bear it no more, Anakin returned to Tatooine, with her in tow, to find [Shmi Skywalker]. 
	
	Anakin did find his dying mother, and [lashed out] in vengeance against the [Tusken Raiders] that had tortured her. When he returned to her, he confessed his actions, and he collapsed with shame and despair over what he had done. She saw the wounded, sobbing youth, and let her compassion guide her heart as she comforted him. 
	
	Shortly thereafter, Anakin and Padmé voyaged to Geonosis, to rescue Obi-Wan who had been captured by Separatist forces. Padmé hoped to use her diplomatic skills to [parley] with the Separatists, but she and Anakin were captured by the Geonosians. Placed on trial for espionage, Amidala and Anakin were sentenced for execution. 
	
	Faced with overwhelming evidence of her mortality, Padmé lowered her emotional guard and professed her love to Anakin. The two were then placed in an execution arena alongside Obi-Wan, and three deadly beasts were unleashed upon them, much to the delight of the Geonosian spectators. Though sustaining a glancing slash from a ferocious [nexu], Padmé held her own, and disappointed her would-be executioners. 
	
	The spectacle was cut short with the arrival of Jedi reinforcements, and then the opening battle of the historic Clone Wars. Despite her initial objections to a Republic army, she nonetheless fought alongside the newly created [clone troopers] against the Separatist droid forces. 
	
	After the Battle of Geonosis, Anakin escorted [Padmé Amidala] back to Naboo. There, at a secluded lake retreat, the same place where their [forbidden love] began to blossom, the two were quietly wed in a ceremony witnessed only by [C-3PO] and [R2-D2]. This tranquil expression of love preceded some of the darkest moments to be faced by Amidala and by the galaxy as a whole. 
	
	She continued to serve the Senate faithfully, though she was often distracted by the growing career of her secret husband. Anakin was becoming a war hero known throughout the Republic, and while the citizens thrilled at his exploits, she was deeply worried for his safety. The few moments they could snatch together were all too brief. The war was concentrated in the Outer Rim, far from Coruscant, and Padmé saw very little of Anakin. By the time the Outer Rim Sieges ended, Padmé had stunning news to deliver to Anakin --- he was to be a father. 
	
	The war years saw the continued transformation of the Republic. To efficiently battle the Separatists on numerous fronts, Chancellor Palpatine enacted executive decrees that saw more power [funneled] to his office, stripping away the last of [the Senate's] lackluster ability to wage war. Many welcomed the [handover] of power, particularly the corrupt politicians. But Padmé became the moral center for a number of idealistic Senators who grew wary of [Palpatine's] amendments. Favoring a diplomatic solution within the boundaries of the law, Padmé began collecting the pledges of what would become the Delegation of 2,000, a group of disaffected Senators formally critical of Palpatine's rule.
		Example: [Queen Amidala] is the reason I go to see [Star Wars] in theaters.

	The most famous Queen Elizabeth is [Elizabeth I] of England, the last Tudor monarch. Her modern day namesake is [Elizabeth II] who ascended the throne of Great Britain, the British Empire and the Commonwealth on [6 February] 1952.
	
	There was also an ocean liner, 'Queen Elizabeth", but  [Cunard];s "[QE2]" is not named after the present Queen as some may think. Rather, it is the 'second' version of the first ship, which is, let's face it, named after the first [Gloriana] herself. 
	
	Elizabeth I was arguably the greatest monarch in English history, a capable hunter, brilliant orator and intellectual (she translated ancient latin and greek texts in her spare time). Her greatest achievement was staying in power for over forty years despite the plots of Mary, Queen of Scots, the Pope, the Spanish and her own lovers. She also commissioned the great explorer and privateer Sir Francis Drake and was a patron of Shakespeare. Her most famous speeches were delivered at [Tilbury] where she rallied her troops against the [Spanish Armada], and in Parliament where she declared in her 'Golden Speech' that the 'greatest prize' of her reign had been to rule 'with your loves'. Elizabeth I also attempted to settle the religious question by declaring she did not 'seek a window into mens souls'.
	
	Ironically, Elizabeth II has witnessed the end of that same empire, but has also proved enduringly popular with her subjects, as witness by her Jubilee celebrations, though being in now way an orator or wit along Elizabethan lines. Her reign was heralded in the1950s as 'a second Elizabethan Age', but notice how quickly that one died out.
		Example: "[God] [Save] [Queen Elizabeth]!"

Queen Mab
	(2004-05-16 +67/-20)
	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes in shape no bigger than an [agate] stone on the forefinger of an alderman, Drawm with a team of little atomi, Over men's noses as they lie asleep. Her wagon spokes made of long spinners' legs, the cover of the wings of grasshoppers, her traces of the smallest spider web, her collars of the [moonshine's] wat'ry beams, her whip of [cricket's] bone, the lash of film, her [wagoner] a small gray-coated gnat, not half so big as a round little worm pricked from the lazy finger of a maid. Her chariot is an empty hazelnut, made by the joiner sqirrel or old grub, Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers. And in this state she gallops night by night through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love; on courtiers' knees, that dream on cur'sies straight; O'er lawyer's fingers, who straight dream on fees; O'er ladies' lips, who straight on kisses dream, Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues because their breaths with [sweetmeats] tainted are. Sometimes she gallops o'er a [courtier's] nose, and then he dreams of smelling out a suit. And sometimes comes she with a tithe-pig's tail, tickling a [parson's nose] as he lies asleep; Then he dreams of another [benefice]. Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck, and then dreams he of cutting foreign throats, of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades, of healths five fathom deep, and then anon drums in his ear, at which he stars and wakes and, being thus frighted, swears a prayer or two and sleeps again. This is that very Mab that plats the manes of horses in the night and bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs, which once [untangled] much misfortune [bodes]. This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs, that presses them and learns them first to bear, making them women of good cairrage. This is she-
		Example: I [dreamt] a dream tonight. And so did I. Well, what was yours? That dreamers often lie. In bed asleep, while they do dream things true. O, then I see Queen Mab [hath] [been with] you.

Queens English
	(2004-07-20 +215/-66)

	There are some who deride [the Queen's] English as too [exacting], too demanding, and accuse it of being a tool to discredit those who may have a valid point, but lack formal education, and are inarticulate, and use slang and incorrect grammar.

queerplatonic
	(2013-07-23 +1309/-112)
	Adjective describing a relationship which is more intense and intimate than is considered common or normal for a "friendship", but doesn't fit the traditional sexual-romantic couple model. It is characterized by a strong bond, love, and emotional commitment, yet is not perceived by those involved as "romantic". The relationship may or may not have some elements or degree of sexuality/eroticism at various times, or none - it doesn't matter, because sexuality/sexual exclusivity is not what the relationship is organized around. It's defined by the intensity and significance of the emotional connection.
	
	The people involved do not have to identify as "queer", it's a type of relationship experienced by and available to anybody regardless of their sexual orientation, [romantic orientation], or (non-)[monogamy]. The people involved in a [queerplatonic relationship] may consider themselves partners, life-partners, a couple, a triad, or any other term that implies the relationship is meaningful, committed and intimate.
	
	Quuerplatonic parters or [QPs] are sometimes referred to as "[zucchini]". As in, "he's my zucchini". This was originally a joke within the asexual/aromantic community, underscoring the lack of words in mainstream relationship discourse to signify meaningful relationships that do not follow the standard and expected sexual/romantic norms, and frustration with the [erasure] of other kinds of intimacy, which were perceived as equally valuable to the sexual/romantic model.
		Example: The reason that i was uncomfortable with the word 'girlfriend' was that i did not want a romantic relationship and the word seemed to imply one: I think what I may have wanted was a [queerplatonic relationship].
		
		I never understood why people were so opposed to affection of any kind towards people that are not dating, I think the world would be better if everybody could cuddle and it was not weird (kind of like how it used to be in [Abe Lincoln's] time when it was normal for men to sleep in the same bed together as a [strictly platonic] thing or like queerplatonic relationships maybe).
		
		They told their friend about queerplatonic partnerships the same day they asked their friend if they could be queerplatonic partners, and they said yes.

	(2015-10-10 +136/-249)
	adjective; a word describing an extremely close emotional relationship that is beyond friendship, but not romantic in nature.

	(2010-07-31 +154/-156)
	Made the brilliant decision of promoting himself first. See for instance his commentary on [TRUE ROMANCE], where he discusses in detail the conscious choices made in putting together his filmography. He's created a compelling public persona in the form of a tireless, foul-mouthed movie geek.
	
	He also shamelessly loots other people's material, but given a pass, proving Van Gogh right that "an ounce of image is worth a pound of performance" (Compare with David Blaine).
	
	To take an example at random, see for instance the famous adrenalin scene in the even more famous film PULP FICTION. As shot it is taken nearly word-for-word from a 70s [Scorsese] documentary on Steven Prince. Prince has all the details: medical dictionary, [magic marker] over the heart, the size of the needle, the jabbing motion, eyes popping open.
	
	This is NOT homage. Homage is a way of honoring others, pedestalizing them. [Tarantino] is a self-promoter first. Go ahead and reference how the Duchess dances in [ARISTOCATS], but taking someone else's story and shooting it almost exactly as described is just sorry.
		Example: Quentin [Tarantino] [Fanboy]: "Tarantino is tha muthafuckin' man, [mah nigga]! He killed off Hitler. I hear in his next movie he's gonna --"
		
		You: Yeah, yeah, yeah, just give me twenty on 3.

	The most deranged, [infantile], misogynistic sociopath ever to walk to the face of the earth. There is a [fine line] between violent serial killer and genius, and this man was saved from a lifestyle of [perversity] by a couple of pretentious movies which base their success from confusing stupid film snobs into thinking his movies are "artistic expression" and by satisfying America's need for blood and destruction. 
		Example: "Doctor, I have urges [to chop] off people's heads and make [lamps] out of them because I think it's funny"
		
		"Diagosis: [Quentin] Tarantino-itis. Therapy: Make a bunch of fucked up movies"
		
		"yayyyy!"

	(2004-04-17 +133/-150)
	[One] [egotistical] muthufucker.

		He was scared to get up and check his drawers but his friends made him. As he stood up, he felt the warm flow and it was confirmed - he sharted.
		
		Too many Miller lites, [greasy pork] rinds, and IHOP that morning.
		
		2) Julie was chillin' and ripped a [diarrhea fart] that was questionable, but she stuck her fingers in her drawers, came out with nothing, then took a long sniff.

Question Spawner
	(2011-04-20 +110/-31)
	Someone who answers a direct question with three stupid, usually unrelated, questions. The “[spawning] questions” are designed to be just a little more [obtuse] or urgent than your original direct question.
	
	What is most annoying, is that the Question Spawner actually believes that he/she has answered your original question.
	
	A Question Spawner is able to magnify the confusion of any given situation [exponentially] -- especially in large group settings.
		Example: You..."Joe, when will you be done with [the project]?"
		
		Question Spawner
		"Do you know when Bill is going to [be back] from vacation?"
		
		"Have you heard whether we are going to release the product into China?"
		
		"Do you know what the advertising [budget] for this project?"
		
		You again...."Joe, when will you be done with the project?"

	(2009-11-07 +85/-330)
	A frightfully shitty webcomic by has-been writer/illustrator extraordinaire [Jeph Jacques]. During the course of the story, which ranks in repetition and [boringness] with [megatokyo], Jaques' artistic abilities have matured, but his dismal writing talents have stayed constant.
		Example: Dude: "Anyone know where I can find an enormously unfulfilling slice-of-life [webcomic]?"
		
		Bro: "Yeah, check out Questionable Content. Come for the fake problems, stay for [the lame], all's-well-that-ends-well story [arcs] that are resolved with no problems at the end of a week."

Questionable Fart
	(2010-08-02 +328/-43)
	A fart that leaves a serious question to oneself and others if a diarrhea squirt or follow-through (shart) has occurred.

	At the behest of [Supreme Chancellor] Valorum, Qui-Gon and his Padawan apprentice [Obi-Wan] Kenobi [journeyed] to [Naboo] to settle the trade dispute that threatened the peaceful world. Aboard a Trade Federation battleship, the Jedi were ambushed, but they managed to escape to [Naboo's] surface. 
	
	In the swamplands of Naboo, Qui-Gon rescued a clumsy [Gungan] outcast, Jar Jar Binks, who swore a life-debt to the Jedi. Qui-Gon's compassionate nature was such that he took the strange alien under his protection. With his help, they journeyed to the city of [Theed]. There, they freed [Queen Amidala] and her [retinue] from the clutches of the Trade Federation, and set off to deliver her safely to [Coruscant]. 
	
	During the trip to the capital, damaged sustained to the Royal Starship forced an unscheduled stop on the Outer Rim world of Tatooine. There, Qui-Gon discovered a young slave boy named Anakin Skywalker, who was strong in the Force. Sensing the boy's potential, Qui-Gon liberated Anakin from slavery. During their departure from Tatooine, Qui-Gon was nearly killed by a dark warrior, whom he suspected to be a Sith Lord. 
	
	The Jedi Master then traveled to Coruscant to present Anakin to the Jedi Council. The Council, however, felt [Anakin's] future seemed clouded and uncertain, and deemed the boy too old to begin training and dangerously full of fear and anger. They refused to allow Qui-Gon to train Anakin, but the Jedi Master nevertheless kept the boy as his ward as he returned to Naboo.
	
	On Naboo, Qui-Gon and Obi-Wan confronted the Sith Lord Darth Maul, Qui-Gon's attacker from the desert. Maul proved a deadly and fearsome opponent. Together, Obi-Wan and Qui-Gon [fended] off the [Sith Lord's] attacks, but as the battle progressed, Master and apprentice became separated. Maul pressed his advantage, wearing down Qui-Gon's defenses and ultimately killing the Jedi Master. Obi-Wan then defeated Maul, but nothing could save Qui-Gon. With his last breath, the Jedi Master asked Obi-Wan to train Anakin, a request Kenobi accepted. 
	
	A short time later, the Jedi Master's body was cremated at a funeral attended by numerous mourners, including Anakin, Obi-Wan, Jar Jar, and several Jedi Council members.

Quick Scope
	(2010-12-16 +942/-254)
	A tactic used by [snipers] in FPS video games. Older than [the COD] franchise, this tactic has been made heavily popular with COD: Modern Warfare 1 and 2. One of the biggest debates surrounding quick [scoping] is whether or not the tactic requires real skill, how much skill, or if it's just a matter of repetition and blind probability.
	
	The tactic itself involves utilizing quick reflexes to spot an enemy, center them on screen as best as possible, and then zoom into your scope only to then fire as soon as the crosshairs are visible.
	
	Some view it as an exploit. This is due to the fact that the crosshairs essentially "[lock on]" briefly and allow one to achieve relatively easy [one-shot] kills. A missed shot usually means one need only quickly repeat. Since it's primarily dependent upon reflexes and simple visual cues, sufficient practice by any player eventually leads to the ability to [quick scope] repeatedly with a diminishing overall vulnerability while doing so.
	
	The tactic is helpful for snipers while they're [on the run], in [close quarters], in place of a weaker secondary weapon. However, abuse of the tactic as a primary method of fighting has lead many to view it as the "cheap" preference of noobs. Many who rely on quick scoping have furthered this stereotype by abusing it repeatedly, even going as far as ridiculing those who snipe in more traditional fashions (often calling them "hard scopers" in a derogatory manner).
		Example: Man, I was playing [Modern Warfare 2] last night. I kept getting killed by this noob who did nothing but [run around] and [quick scope]. His hits were like 1 in 10, but he did it so frantically that he got enough kills to annoy us. His team still lost, though.

	(2011-12-05 +374/-240)
	Pussy-assed n00b tactic in FPS games, particularly the Modern Warfare games, who exploit the cheap auto-aim bot that [center's] your reticule on your target if you aim downsight while he is nearby. They primarily use [the Barrett] and Intervention sniper rifles, and do nothing but dart around the map one-shot-killing everybody with no regard for the cheapness of the tactic they are employing. They even make fun of players who use [the sniper rifle] the right way.
		Example: That [noob] just wants to do nothing but [run around] and [quick scope] everybody. Let's team up on him and take him down.

	(2012-01-14 +109/-136)
	When you [beat your dick off] inside your pants for awhile until you are about to explode. At the point of [blowing your load], you whip out your dick (your primary weapon) and proceed to dispense your white, [translucent] warm ammo on your victim!
		Example: Oh my god! i just quick [scoped] that [cougar] on [the subway]!

	(2012-01-31 +68/-94)
	To [check out] an [attractive person] without them [catching] you doing it.
		Example: yo you should [quick scope] that [ho's] ass but don't let her see you doing [that shit].

	(2010-06-20 +147/-270)
	A [Quick scope] was born from the Call Of Duty and Halo franchises. The idea is to pull in your scope and shoot at the moment you see your crosshairs. this can be useful in combat because a skilled player may be able to pull this off and get accurate, one-shot kills. This is normally for show and is not the best way to play unless you want to impress others by making videos or compilations. [Machinima.com] is a great place to find these montages and skill in [Quickscoping].
		Example: xXLegi1tSnipeZz x tried to knife me but i Quick [Scoped] him and got [a one shot] kill. stupid [nooblet].

	(2010-07-28 +148/-273)

	The act of using [mouthwash] to [freshen] breath; usually used to [cover up] smoking or consuming alcohol.
		Example: *[two guys] smoking*
		Guy 1: Yo dude, you think our breath will [stink]?
		Guy 2: Yeah dawg, let's go Quick Scope" [in a minute].

	(2010-09-24 +1588/-474)
	A person who quick scopes will use a sniper rifle, but instead of aiming down the scope [like sniper] [riffles] were made for, they exploit a feature and shoot when the cross hairs meet, resulting in a one hit kill, despite the fact a majority of the time the cross hairs miss the target. Then when somebody uses a sniper riffle for what it was meant for and look down the scope, the people who quick scope yell at the player who looked down the scope and call them a "[hard scoper]"
		Example: I would like to see those [quick] scope kids go to [Afghanistan] and try quick [scoping].

	(2010-04-29 +28/-20)
	A kill in FPS games like Modern Warfare 2, where the person using a sniper rifle (like the Intervention, [M40A3], or [R700]) zooms in with the regular scope barely enough for the cross-hairs inside the scope to become visible or just before resulting in a Dark Scope and then firing the weapon resulting in a kill. Thus the Quick-Scope.
	
	Perfect MW2 Class for this: Intervention+FMJ, Sleight of Hand Pro, Stopping Power Pro, Ninja Pro (cause noobs need [steady aim]).
		Example: OMG! Did you see that!?!?! I just 360 quick-scoped [OpTic] DTreats across [the map] on [Overgrown]!

		As soon as the bell rang for the start of recess I ran to the closet, where I found Hanna sitting completely naked, shoving a dildo in and out of her pussy. I somehow got even harder. She stopped fucking herself and started making out with me, unbuttoning my pants and shirt in the meantime. Soon enough, I was naked too. I pushed her into the wall and slammed my [solid dick] into her tight, [wet cunt], and sucked and [bit on] her tits. She started moaning loudly, and I rammed my length into her pussy even harder and faster. I shot my cum into her cunt, filling it and making it drip with the combination of our cums. She was so pleased that she [knelt] [down in front] of me and pushed my entire cock into her mouth. She sucked and [swirled] for a few minutes before I came in her mouth, and she swallowed every last drop. We both got dressed again and before I left she said, “Meet here, same time, tomorrow?”
		
		I quickly replied, “Only if you promise to last longer next time.”
		
		Turned out, we fucked each other 1-2 times a day for the rest of senior year. We started dating and eventually got married. Now we work at the same place and have quickies once an hour.

quickscoping
	(2010-12-13 +126/-39)
	an once cool/badass technique used by [gamer's] in the days where kids played pokemon or [some other shit].
	but since the mw2'ish days it have become widely popular, and now every little kid now knows this technique, this would be fine if you didnt have to hear them complain about you "[hardscoping]" and them telling how much 1337 skill they have, these fags tend to use mods like aimbot and prestige hacks.
	conclusion:quickscoping is actually a cool way to play the game, its not skilled nor is it non skilled. just dont brag about it and complain about others style of playing the game
		Example: 0pt1csnipezzPR0!:nice [hardscope] kid!

		Example: "Dude, I just got [such a beast] [quickscope]."
		
		"Yeah, [up yours] too buddy."

	(2012-06-28 +44/-17)
	A Quickscope is a close quarters technique/tactic which was generally an expliot at first. It is utilized by many gamers in Close Proximity with another player [to Frag] them, aka kill them. It was born in 1999 in a PC FPS game that is still bery popular known as Counter-Strike. The tactic is now used by many other games including Halo, Gears of War, Day of Defeat, Battlefield, & Call of duty. Most players now that do this technique over use it and call out other players that do not use the tactic when sniping.
	
	Most Call of duty [Quickscopers] only use [the sniper rifle] for this tactic because they think they are famous over youtube, or that being an on a youtube channel with a number next to their name makes them notorious. Other fps gamers do this technique for fun or when they are under pressure i.e Clutching a game while using a sniper rifle the old traditional way. They do not overuse it they do not boast about them being better than others when doing it, they just play like any other normal gamer.
	
	[Quickscoping] should not be an excuse for gamers to think they are better and more skilled than other players just because they have a new style of sniping.
		Example: A 1 second [zoom in] of a scope with any type of [high powered rifle].
		
		Gamer 1: Hey man did you see that kids final killcam he [quickscoped] me.
		Gamer 2: yeah he and his friends have been doing them non-stop, I think they are overrated.

	(2011-02-28 +229/-123)
	When a person plays [Call of Duty] too long and develops a [nervous] "twitch" and cannot aim in correctly while using a [sniper].
	
	They often think they are 'more skilled' than all the other players, and are quite full of themselves.
		Example: WOW I just got a QuickScope on [that guy]! [IM] [SO BEAST]!

	(2009-08-07 +289/-160)
	A technique of aiming with a [sniper rifle] that was born in the Call of Duty franchise. The idea is to position your opponent in the middle of your screen and then proceed to shoot your sniper rifle just as your character brings the scope up to their view, hence a "[quickscope]". The advantage being that your accuracy is not affected by sway and is much more reliable than a [no scope].
		Example: I was [caught off guard] up close by my opponent but I whipped around and [nailed] a [quickscope] just before he killed me.

	(2011-09-17 +86/-50)
	A popular exploit of a [glitch] in some FPS video games wherein a player is able to scope in with a sniper rifle, shoot for a kill, then [scope out] almost instantly and without having to ensure the crosshairs are on the target. Gamers who have become dependent on the [QS] exploit for success have lobbied hard to developers, pleading that the QS should be kept in the game because it constitutes a 'style of play'. They base this [contention] for the most part on the notion that (by some accounts) it takes practice to become skilled at QS, though critics point out that the amount of practice it takes to master an exploit is hardly a good argument for keeping a glitch. The QS exploit is also popular because it easily allows for long kill-streaks and unlikely kills which more [self-indulgent] gamers in the community produce in montages for each other.
		Example: Oh man, it's completely unrealistic and contrary to the [spirit of the game], but I've gotten very good at running around exploiting the [quickscope] [glitch] for fast, easy kills.

	(2010-07-25 +46/-26)
	A [Quick scope] was born from the Call Of Duty and Halo franchises. The idea is to pull in your scope and shoot at the moment you see your crosshairs. this can be useful in combat because a skilled player may be able to pull this off and get accurate, [one-shot] kills. This is normally for show and is not the best way to play unless you want to impress others by making videos or compilations. [Machinima.com] is a great place to find these montages and skill in Quickscoping.
		Example: Dude 1: Wow he's so good at [quickscoping]
		Dude 2: Yeah you aim in quickly at watches the enemy on the [scope] and [triggers] as soon as you aim in.

	(2011-11-17 +33/-28)
	The tactic itself involves utilizing quick reflexes to spot an enemy, center them on screen as best as possible, and then zoom into your scope only to then fire as soon as the crosshairs are visible.
	
	Some view it as an exploit. This is due to the fact that the crosshairs essentially "lock on" briefly and allow one to achieve relatively easy one-shot kills. A missed shot usually means one need only quickly repeat. Since it's primarily dependent upon reflexes and simple visual cues, sufficient practice by any player eventually leads to the ability to [quick scope] repeatedly with a diminishing overall vulnerability while doing so.
	
	The tactic is helpful for snipers while they're on the run, in [close quarters combat], in place of a weaker secondary weapon. However, abuse of the tactic as a primary method of fighting has lead many to view it as the "cheap" preference of noobs. Many who rely on quick scoping have furthered this stereotype by abusing it repeatedly, even going as far as ridiculing those who snipe in more traditional fashions (often calling them "hard scopers" in a derogatory manner).
	
	[Quickscoping] was founded in 1999 during a game mod known as Counter-Strike by guy guy named "CaLL Me God" and another guy named "Incorporated" They listed Quickscoping as a Technique used only for [Close Quarters Combat]. It was to be used only when sniping at Close range to medium range.
		Example: "Man, I was playing [Modern Warfare 2] last night. I kept getting killed by this noob who did nothing but [run around] and [quickscope]. His hits were like 1 in 10, but he did it so frantically that he got enough kills to annoy us. His team still lost, though."

	(2010-12-14 +16/-36)
	Someone who plays videogames involving them quickly [zooming] in, firing at a target, then quickly [zooming out], originally used to see the full screen, instead of down the [scope].
		Example: [Gamer]: "Dude Quickscopers are awesome, like this guy [zzirGrizz] gets [laid] all the time because of it! ill be like him!

QuickTime
	(2014-12-17 +50/-2)
	Awful media player by Apple which is usually installed by people only because they need it to run a .[MOV] file, Apple's shitty proprietary video format. Constantly freezes or lags out on older computers and laptops, and has the ugliest, most unintuitive GUI ever. Has features that require a paid PRO license which are free in other programs, such as video conversion. Has absolutely no support at all for the Windows version. It leaves behind various malware such as Apple Application Support and Apple [Software Update] when [uninstalled].
		Example: If you're planning to [install] QuickTime, you [might as well] use [Windows Media Player].

	(2004-10-18 +489/-117)

	(2005-03-06 +29/-42)

	An [annoying] [virus] [program].
		Example: FUCK YOU [QUICKTIME]! LET ME EDIT THIS VIDEO!
		
		OH MY GOD I WASTED MY MONEY ON QUICKTIME
		
		[THIS IS SHIT]! [LAUGH OUT LOUD], DON'T EVEN TOUCH MY VIDEOS!
		
		"Did you just download [Quicktime]?"
		"Ya"
		"Oh shit... you just ruined your videos."

	(2008-07-25 +180/-37)
	A [pointless] program made to run movies. Annoys [the fucking] hell out of you when you accidentally [click] on it.
		Example: [Oh shit], this video needs [quicktime]. [Fuck that]

	(2004-10-09 +30/-4)
	Originating from the Apple program that performs this action, to be [quicktimed] is to install a program that adds numerous hidden [registry] keys, an icon on the desktop, in quick launch and in the [start menu] without your approval.
		Example: "Dude, I just [installed] a porn app and now there's [tons of] [icons] and shit,"
		"Dude, you've been Quicktimed!"

	(2006-05-11 +150/-59)
	A video format from Apple with the shittiest and gayest [SDK] I have ever seen, and even worse documentation. Includes such revealing function names as MoviesTask(), and short, easy to type constant names as kQTMovieAudioExtractionPropertyID _AudioStreamBasicDescription. Actually has a constant called DoTheRightThing, and calls setting things up "preflighting". I can just picture Quicktime engineers sitting in their [turtleneck] sweaters thinking that using words like "[preflight]" somehow makes them cool. Having spent some time with the Quicktime [APIs] I think I can safely assume that general Mac development is just as retarded.
		Example: Dude, I have been trying to find what numerical value kQTAnnoyingLongAssConstantNames _IDontHaveTwentyFingersToTypeThisShit [maps] to in the Quicktime [header] files, but haven't had [any luck] so far.

	(2006-06-21 +136/-78)
	A [gay-ass] media player that you have to install in order to hear the audio on [YTMND] in [Firefox]. Also installs stupid iTunes with it.
		Example: [Quicktime] is [so gay] it's [gay].

	(2006-08-15 +98/-71)
	1 - Not a video format, but a file container. The container is an open standard that relies on often [proprietary] codecs to deliver [audio and video]. Released originally in 1991 for the Macintosh, the underlying container hasn't changed much from its original specifications. This is essential, however - for the backwards compatibility that the platform delivers is unmatched by any other multimedia platform, except for perhaps Xiph.[org's] [Ogg] container.
	
	[Quicktime] is typically known for its proprietary codecs as of Quicktime 3.0 or later which have been used to deliver audio and video over the Internet. Not known for top-notch streaming quality, the platform since 1999 has more or less been used to deliver progressive-download movies. Such as those found on ign64.ign.com ; the [archived] IGN Nintendo 64 news website.
	
	Critics would argue that the platform is bloated, although no spyware or malware is distributed. A stand-alone installer is available for those that do not want iTunes, although iTunes is dependent upon the platform. Most of the proprietary codecs have been reverse-engineered, allowing playback in such players as [VLC]. Recently, Apple has moved away from standards such as [Sorenson] Video and qDesign music to insist on somewhat of a truly compatible model ; as supposed by the heavily patented MPEG-4 standard.
	
	Quicktime directly competed with Real [Network's] real audio / video standard, Microsoft Windows Media, and Xiph's Ogg multimedia platform.
		Example: 1- [Quicktime] is a container, not a video type. 
		2 - Quicktime sucks! It's so bloated! Yeah, if you try playing back high-res [AVC] on a Northwood...
		3 - Major media outlets use Quicktime to fight off the invasion of the rather sucky Windows Media Video format.
		4 - Quicktime is nice, but [Theora] is more useful for video despite its aging video portion..

	(2020-06-12 +100/-13)
	A term used to describe sexual intercourse that has either lasted a short amount out time, involved absolutely [no foreplay], or [only one] of the participants actually [got off].
		Example: A husband might say, "Hey babe, wanna have [a Quickie]?!" And the wife might [respond], "Not if you're going to leave me [hanging] again."

	(2004-02-23 +2136/-541)
	It is common after spending years in a relationship for the urgency and thrill once felt with sex to [wane]. Having a ‘quickie’ now and then....fast sex with little foreplay.....is a great way to spice things up and revive some of the [spontaneity] and excitement that may be lacking in a mundane love life.
	
	For those who don’t know, “quickie” is the term given to a sexual [romp] that is exactly that – quick. It is to the point, exciting and usually quite intense. And it is often more animalistic and lust-driven than regular “romantic” sex.
		Example: Five-minute [frolics] are great because they are reminiscent of the beginning of a relationship when it is difficult to keep hands off one another. When you’re constantly trying to break away whenever possible to enjoy some physical contact with each other. When attractions are so strong that you don’t even bother to get fully undressed before going at it. It is these intense desires that are at the heart of the quickie.
		
		In addition to being a great way to injecting passion back into your relationship, quickies are a handy time-management tool in a busy life. There may be day-to-day commitments that prevent you from having sex as often as you use to. Or, maybe at the end of the day, you or your partner are just too tired from working and looking after the kids to get involved in an hour-long lovemaking session. [A quickie] is a great way to still get some [sexual satisfaction], without having to devote too much time or energy!
		
		Now, while quickies are a great way to get pleasure and keep the fire of love alive, it is not advised to ONLY have quickies. A loving, [healthy relationship] demands balance. Having an occasional quickie can demonstrate there is still passion in the relationship. However, making love (the romantic kind!) and taking the time to satisfy and thoroughly enjoy each other, is necessary for strengthening intimacy. 
		
		Just as long as it is mutually agreed upon (i.e. both of you know in advance that it’s going to be short and sweet), quickies are great way to [reconnect] with one another and are a great solution to trying to schedule sex around hectic lifestyles. There’s nothing wrong (or selfish!) with wanting a brief and exciting break and then getting back to the dishes, [paying bills] or whatever you were in the middle of doing!
		
		"I was sitting in my study chair with CALCULUS [301] on my mind. I was wearing just my [bathrobe]. She came into the room naked, sat on my lap, and proceeded to give me [a quickie] then disappeared leaving me to concentrate."

	(2003-09-13 +1155/-493)
	A [sexual activity] done in a quick, [orderly] fashion as to not [spoil] the moment.
		Example: Bob got [a quickie] right [b4] [the party].

	(2008-04-06 +935/-404)
	"[a quickie]" is the term for [a short], [passionate] version of sex.
		Example: They were outside in the woods. It was time for [a quickie]. She ripped off his pants. He grabbed her boobs as he kissed her, taking in her every curve. She removed his boxers and she pulled down her own jeans. They wanted each other so much that they didn't even bother taking off their shirts. He pulled off her panties and threw them aside. Since they were outside, he didn't want to [ravage] her on the ground, so he picked her up and she wrapped her legs around his waist. He [pinned] her up against a tree and kissed her more. He was super hard, so he entered her [wet pussy] and started to pump in and out. She moaned loudly when she felt how big he was. He kept thrusting deeper into her and she continued to feel the pressure inside of her building. They came at the same time and it was amazing.

[Voluntary] quiet kids are often loners, who are very self-sufficient, and can in some cases be motivated to stay unnoticed, or low-key. Involuntary quiet kids may have shy tendencies, and may actually be too timid to initiate friendship. Often labled as mysterious, or weird by classmates. Many have suffered negative lables by judgemental people such as: gay, emo, goth, 'mental', shy, rude, mean, stuck-up, and boring, which is unfair to [the quiet kid], because most people (yes, even teachers), make these [judgements] without taking the time to understand or get to know the individual. Often the quiet-kid is not "boring" as some may suggest, but instead may not feel that the people in their environment are good for their personality, especailly with most people being so judgemental anyway.
		Example: Adult [colleague]: So what were you like in highschool?
		Friend: It's [actually funny], because I was actually the "quiet kid."

This kid could be the smartest kid in the class, but every time he says anything, he isn't listened to, and others around him steal his answers and yell them out. This is the kid who is [not well] known by most of the class. When students pass out papers, they say "who is (insert name of [the quiet kid] here)?" The only time people ever talk to the quiet kid are when they need something. It's never to talk about TV or video games or the internet, it's always "what did you get for [number 3]?" or "what was the homework for English class?" [The quiet kid] will go home every day, with a huge backpack, on the bus, and one day he'll stop showing up at school, and no one will notice or care. People will assume he switched classes and went somewhere else. It would be as if he never even existed...

	they do not like being socially awkward because it can limit them from future jobs/normal conversations that they want to have.
	they in fact do not know the definite reason why they're quiet, and when people ask why they're quiet, they shrug their shoulders or say "IDK".
	
	quiet kids are typically smart and they may also have a friend(s) that they awkwardly (not rudely) talk to and wish they could have more friends and be more verbal but their nervousness and amount of overthinking make it appear impossible. [the quiet kid] could be the person who has encountered when a person is passing out papers and they say
	
	"([quiet kid's] name) is in this class? he never talks." they also try to speak loud enough for everyone to hear but wind up being too quiet.

We hate them because they are boring or [faking depression]. But inside of a quiet kid is fun, they never shown themselves, they are shy and quiet in school. However, when they go home, they go loud.
	
	Im a quiet kid too.
	
	Most teachers know that shy students are like anyone else in their class: we want to reach them and hope that they have a good class experience. I have never known a teacher to dislike a shy student, if that is what you are asking. ... As an introvert myself, I relate to these students very well!

Quiet Riot
	(2007-11-29 +63/-13)
	1. a person who appears to be solemn and calm in public, yet really lets loose and gets wild during afterhours or while alone with one person, like a lover.
	
	2. a glam metal band that scored big in the 80s. Their first international album "[Metal Health]" made it to the top of the album chart in the autumn of 1983. It is the first heavy metal album to top the chart. Also, "Cum On Feel the [Noize]" ( a Slade cover), "Bang Your Head (Metal Health)", "Slick [Black Cadillac]", "Run for Cover" and more from that album were hits. Other hits the band scored were "Mama Weer All [Crazee] Now", "Party All Night", "Stomp Your Hands, Clap Your Feet", "Condition Critical", the funk-inflected "The Wild and the Young" and a lot more. Singer Kevin DuBrow was found dead this week, as of yet no information has been released about his death. Heavy metal underwent a further step in it's evolution in the 80s when the vocals became more screamed, a tendency that was  spearheaded by  bands like AC/DC and Def Leppard, and Kevin was more than fit for the job - he could belt them out with the best of them. He was notorious for his wild antics on stage. At a 2000  concert in Columbus, Ohio he talked about [glam metal's] glory days in the fun 80s and how the music scene changed in the "[fucking PC 90s]" (his exact words). He made the band what it was. He was 52. RIP Kevin. Rest your head, weer really are all [crazee] now. VIVA ROCK'N'ROLL!
		Example: 1. Mike acted like an introvert in class, but after school he dropped LSD into his [soft drink] and made out with and screwed his girlfriend underneath the [bleachers]. He was a complete [quiet riot]. Very few people knew of this.
		
		2. When [Quiet Riot] played live in concert they were anything but quiet. You could do what their signature song says - bang your head. Quiet Riot ROCKs!

	(2004-07-26 +188/-51)
	Quiet Riot was a hair metal band in the 80's. No one has heard of any of their songs except the [mega hit] Cum On Feel The Noize. Bigger rock fans have heard of [Metal Health]/Bang Your Head. Quiet Riot happens to be one of my favorite bands. They're original guitarist [Randy Rhoads] left the band to do some work with Ozzy. The biggest song he helped write was Crazy Train.
		Example: Cum On Feel The [Noize]
		Girls rock [your boys]
		We get wild wild wild wild
		wild wild wild
		So you think [my voice] is outta time
		it makes me money
		and i dont know why
		etc

	(2011-10-25 +15/-4)

		Example: Man my girlfriend was [yelling] at me [on the phone] yesterday, but I barely caught a word. I was busy in a [quiet riot].

	(2009-06-11 +13/-4)
	A metal band from the 80s. Call them hair if you like, but unlike Twisted Sister they never dressed in drag. Mostly died with the downfall of the hair metal scene, but they're a band that are still on the [headbanger's] radar. Or they were, until Kevin DuBrow checked out on a cocaine overdose in his Las Vegas house in 2007.
	
	Known mainly for their mega-hit "Cum On Feel The Noize" and their #1 album 'Metal Health', [Quiet Riot] were much like [Dokken] - one of the most underrated bands out there. Kevin DuBrow's great vocals helped but his songwriting didn't; however [Frankie Banali] was one of the best drummers on the LA scene back then. Rudy Sarzo was a good bassist and Carlos Cavazo was also a great guitarist.
	
	Headbangers and metalheads worldwide will however know them for songs like 'Metal Health' - the number one headbanger anthem - 'Slick Black Cadillac', 'Mama Weer All [Crazee] Now', 'Love's A Bitch' as well as 'Cum On Feel The Noize'. One less well known song was 'Danger Zone' which could shake a house down but didn't make it past the demo stage.
	
	Their biggest achievement was [Metal Health]; not only did it hit number 1 in 1983 but it also made its mark as the first ever metal album to do so.
	
	I'm a fan of Quiet Riot.
		Example: [Quiet Riot] were responsible for the classic [headbanger's] anthem - [Metal Health].
		
		I got the boys
		To make the noise
		Won't ever let up, hope it annoys you!
		Join the pack
		Fill the crack
		Well now you're here, there's no way back!
		
		Bang your head!!
		Metal health'll drive you mad
		Bang your head!!
		Metal health'll drive you mad

Quincy, Illinois
	(2009-02-27 +220/-151)
	A city near [the Mississippi River] that is hands-down the worst place on earth.
	
	Everyone here is either:
	A)old, sick, or both
	B)[FSD]
	C)drunk or on drugs
	or
	D)dying to get out
	
	[Quincy] is horrible. If you don't make it out by 25, you're stuck here forever. It is a cultural abyss. Trends make it here about 3 years after they've been popular everywhere else. Everyone mispronounces everything. Everyone goes deerhunting. The men have no limits to their stupidity and the girls are either super Christians or total whores.
	
	Don't ever come here.
	Please.
		Example: Quincy, Illinois is a great [place] to be from, but a [horrible] place to [live].

	(2012-01-22 +104/-72)
	The place where dreams come to die.
	A [cultural wasteland] with no redeeming qualities.
	The 'city' is pretty much ruled by crotchety old people who are easily annoyed. People are devoid of any form of entertainment besides movies, church, and eating themselves to death at the many resturaunts and bars, ([They out] number ALL other businesses). We have a college that requires religious courses to attend and a community college that just plain sucks....
	
	The WEATHER makes [front page news], for christ sake!
	
	Nothing ever happens here.
	Except birth, meth, teenage pregnancy, and death.
	There are more dead people here than living.
	Total living: 40, 100 Buried: 42,000 IN ONE cemetery!
	We have at LEAST five.
	
	Agree with definition #1. Worst place to live. Best place to die.
		Example: I REALLY hate myself;so I'll commit suicide. Drugs are too [pricey], guns are too quick, and [slitting] my wrists too messy. I know! I'll just [move to] Quincy, Illinois!

	[Leave on] [Probation]

		Have you seen those b-movies where the hot girls go through the small town and get arrested for [trumped up] charges and forced to do hot late night kinds of things. That's Quincy, Illinois only to everyone [hot or not] and no cool sex to speak of unless your consider the [reaming] you get at court.
		
		Yes could I get the Johnny law special with no lube please.

	(2014-01-15 +21/-71)
	A place where dreams can be restored. When you don't like the way it is change it. Give your best.
	
	Many people here are hurting. The drugs and negative lifestyles are [a cry for help]. Burdens weigh heavy. Men are thought to treat women like crap because of the example they have in their lives. Women accept harm and destruction in their lives because they see their mothers accept it. [Quincy] isn't a horrible place to live we just need change and God to change our hearts on how we view Quincy. We can make a choice, either sit and watch it [fall apart] or get out and make a change.
	
	God is only limited by your faith and belief. He can make the change.
		Example: Quincy, Illinois where [change] is [possible]

Quizilla
	(2004-09-21 +729/-134)
	A web site where users have the ability to create quizzes on ANY subject then add questions and answers to their preference. This has proved increasingly popular but probmatic too, all down to this exact reason. The pages within used to be rather cool and somewhat...fun, but now it has been infested with little children either making pointless surveys where they desperatley plea for "cyber", giving on the option "yes" to it all, leading to their e-mail addresses popping [up on the screen] of results, or they just make rubbish questionaires like "[GOFFIK] OR NOT!!!111", or "R U GAY/AS COOL AS ME???".
	
	However, there are some witty and [mature people] on the site, though the only "masterpieces" they make are honestly...NOT quizzes at all, rather very long, perennial and boring romance "novels", which usually go by the names of "A date with a vampire - part 45" or "The hot [foreign exchange student] at Hogwarts - chapter 12". These are all just a subtle way to do the exact same thing as their toddler enemies, as usually they will get "rated" the "highest score" by poor, helpless teenage girls who focus on nothing more than gaining around 5 boyfriends on the doomed website by sending countless numbers of private messages to the authors.
		Example: All in all, Quizilla was once a unique and [informative] experiece of what other people can [think up], but now it it cursed and has little hope of any [restoration] from it's former glory...

	(2006-05-09 +110/-26)
	In the beginning, there was Quizilla. A wonderfull site where you could just [dick around] with quizzes like, "What [FFVII] Character do you most resemble?" and such things like that. Then came the "Story Quizzes" which used imagination and halarity to tell decent stories from a person whole imagination. As the site became more popular, there also came quizzes like, "A night with Harry Potter-78- WOW YOU'RE GOOD!!" Along with useless spamming.
	
	Now the site is over-run with [cheesey] [fanfics] about fictional characters, and celebraties, written by wanna-be writers [who're] [lonly] and decide to share their secret fantasies with the rest of the world. 
	
	Sadly, it is now hard to find a decent story quiz, and because of the useless fangirls that have overrun the site, most of the better writers have left. 
	
	Now, Quizilla isn't a bad site at all. It offers messaging, creation of your own quizzes, a confused and useless search engine, and a dedicated creator. But if you want to find a decent story among the masses of fanfics, spam-quizzes, and cyber offers, it might take you a bit of time. Of course, [a good story] is always rare.
		Example: Good quiz-masters:
		Aimegirl
		WickedWench
		OriginOfSpecies
		WingzOfNocte
		
		[Bad] quiz-masters:
		[78]% of the [authors] on Quizilla

	(2004-10-11 +373/-142)
	A website where users may create their own quizzes.  This is bad for the most part, as most of these are not quizzes at all, but redundant and pointless stories about Harry Potter, [Yu Yu Hakusho], [Inu Yasha], and a variety of other things that nobody save for 13-year-old girls with [liquid shit] for brains cares about.  There are also various quizzes there to remind people what high school clique they are in.
		Example: Quizilla has more spam than a [paranoid] [guy's] [basement].

	(2005-10-15 +63/-20)
	Despite it's popular [beginnings] as a web site dedicated to online "quizzes" that often define personality types and what kind of characters you resemble, Quizilla formed and morphed into something similar, if not MORE popular, than [fanfiction.net]. Meaning quizzes no longer [predominate], stories about celebrities and romances do.
	
	Most of the "popular" stories are based on Harry Potter and written by teenage girls between the ages of 13-17. The actually good stories, however, are usually based off of some attractive male in a famous rock band. These are typically more matured and intelligent.
	
	All in all, if you're looking for a good fanfic, try Quizilla. If you're looking for a good QUIZ, go to memegen. 
		Example: WickedWench, FragileCliche, FailureByDesignerJeans are [all good], [popular] [writers] on Quizilla.

	(2006-04-04 +220/-85)
	A once very fun site soley devoted to quizzes, which were inventive, funny and witty. Too bad it is now predominated by [wangsty] fangirls writing TERRIBLE second-person smutfanfiction going by the name of 'XXX Date with Lestat/Voldemort/Kurt Cobain Part [421] XXX' or 'Im the only [gawth] in Hogwrats!!!!!!!!11111 for gurlz only'. Run FAST.
		Example: Quizilla [must be] [saved]. 

	(2009-12-10 +18/-4)
	A site that once [housed] creative stories, quizzes, and poems that has now been over-run by 12 year old girls who have no sense of [proper grammar] and only want to write about falling in love with vampires and anything Twilight related. You can also find a mixture of other popular topics (always romance stories) such as: Any popular anime show, Harry Potter, [Werewolves], and a well known famous person. Anything that is well written and not necessarily about falling in love with a mythical creature will be rejected and rated poorly. A place that once used to be a good outlet to get criticism and post well written pieces of work, Quizilla has become all about getting the best ratings on your crappy story about "Vampire Love".
		Example: Beth: Hey did you see my new story about [Nick Jonas] I posted on Quizilla!!!!!?!?!?!??!!
		Jamie: [No because] Quizilla is for idiots who write the same boring stories and just change around the names and species of [the main character's] love interest.

	(2007-01-19 +26/-7)
	Quizilla is a site for quizzes that has now recently been mostly inhabited by psychotic fangirls. The majority of the site has now been taken up by [fanfics] such as "HW FR [WUD] HARRY POTTER GO WIT U?11?!![1ONE]" or "*~[Frank iero] & YOU!1 (OMGROFLLAWL LEMONZZ!!!11ONE)~*
	
	Not all of [the site's] fanfiction is bad, some of the writers are actually quite dedicated and often put time and effort into their stories, whether or not they are fanfiction. But the most of it has become a sick competition to get your story on the "Most popular" or "Highest rated" list. Out of all the crap, it's hard to find an actually good original story or fanfiction. But if you're lucky, there is a chance that you may find some good stuff.
		Example: pinupgirl54
		xXKissAndTellXx
		SkyDancer15
		& RocketMuffin
		Are good [writers] on Quizilla. [78]% of the others on [the site], are NOT.

	(2006-08-29 +46/-15)
	Quzilla. A site that was once an extremely basic quiz making site, providing hours and hours of mindless fun. 
	
	Slowly but surely, bad Harry Potter and [Anne Rice] fanfiction began to creep onto the site. Eventually, the [admins] embraced this, allowing people to [publish] [fanfics] and people began to post original stories.
	
	More and more functions have been added over the years, such as games and a huge dictionary [of sorts] entitled the Zillapedia. Recently, new story, poem, lyrics and scored quizzes editors have been added to the site, along with a forum which has proved highly popular.
	
	Unfortunately, within Quizilla, there is a battle of sorts to get onto the "Highest Rated" list, and tons of wannabe fangirls write extremely bad bandfics with very bad grammar to try and get on them. Unique ideas no longer exist on Quizilla.
		Example: "Dude, you been on Quizilla?"
		"No, [what is it]?"
		"Like, quizzes, [fanfics] [and stuff]."
		"Rad."

	(2008-02-03 +59/-23)
	A site where [legions] of infuriatingly [fucktarded], rabid emo fangirls congregate to post fanfics and poems about Naruto, [InuYasha] and My Chemical Romance, even when its supposed to be a place for quizzes.
		Example: ~*+*~ omfg a daet [wiv] [sasuke] pt. 45312434 [clik] haer!!!!!oneoneoneoneone ~*+*~
		
		^ Typical "quiz" on Quizilla.

	(2004-05-03 +64/-34)
	An internet site which holds thousands of pointless [quiz] type things, with titles such as, "Which [Blazin Squad] song are you?" However, it's a great way to fill time and you can laugh at the people who make up the Quizs with names like, "How muchof [a busted] fan are you???"
		Example: [Damn it's] 3.30am and i can't [sleep]. I'll [go on] Quizilla

	(2019-01-02 +71/-5)
	Quiznak is a term in the animated show [Voltron] Legendary Defenders and it's closest translation from Altean to English is some combination (or can be used in place of either) of [the f-word] and [dang it].
		Example: "[Quiznak]! You're lucky i have a case of the old ‘sleep [chamber] knees.'" -Coran
		
		"What the [quiznak]?" -almost everyone
		
		"Here's an option: shut your quiznak." Is used incorrectly by [Lance]

	(2018-12-22 +46/-4)
	A word found in the animated series [Voltron Legendary Defender]. It from the Altean language and has no confirmed English equivalent.
	
	However, from context it can be discerned that [quiznak] is some kind of alien swear word. In [the Voltron] fandom it is widely speculated to mean ‘fuck’.
		Example: “[What the] [quiznak]!”
		“Who the quiznak [are you]?!”

_____

Quizno

	(2006-05-13 +67/-20)
	If [you enjoy] cannabis, this has to be one of the best places to grab a tasty snack to satisfy the munchies. 
	
	Being a sub [jockey] at quiznos has to be among the top-ten jobs to have if you  smoke; right up there with musician or [entrepreneur]. Especially if noone ever comes into the store and the boss is rarely, if ever, present.
		Example: If you have eaten at a quiznos [on Route] 40 in [howard county] there is a high probability that your sub was made by one who enjoys to [toke the smoke].

	(2004-12-30 +105/-45)
	A sub joint that boasts [toasted] [subs]. Tasty sandwiches, but very overpriced and the sub-jockey's are a bit anal about what [condiments] you put on it.
		Example: I feel like spending $15 at a [fast food] [joint], let's go to [Quizno's]

	(2004-08-12 +128/-65)
	Good Sandwiches and so are [Subway's].
	
	What [weirds] me out about Quiznos though is those things singing on their commercials.I mean,what the fuck are those [tings] anyways? I haven't been able to figure it out.My best guess is that they are singing abortions.
		Example: Quiznos is good,their [commercials] consist of a couple of singing abortions sitting their singing about their [sandwiches] and their latest [deals].

	(2004-01-03 +337/-213)
	A fine place to get subs, made fresh to order on Quiznos own white or [whole wheat] baguette-style bread. Then [toasted] to golden-brown perfection.  Special sauces and seasonings, [melted cheese], all combined to create the best subs money can buy.

	It is an extremely obscure old English word that was nearly never used, until popularized by Youtube channel [Vsauce], where, in is "The [Zipf] Mystery" episode, at about 17:30 minutes in, he says that the word Quizzacious is in [the oxford dictionary], however, at the time, was only found in a book called "Elder Speak" when searched on Google. "Fittingly enough," Michael (Vsauce) remarked, "it is listed as a rare word". Since it was uncovered by Vsauce, it became a Meme in the Vsauce fanbase. Ironically enough, people often use the term Quizzacious in a Quizzacious manner.
		Example: 1.
		Person A: "Did you see [Alec] Bladwin last night?"
		Person B: "Yeah. He is very Quizzqacious, is he not?"

	(2017-06-17 +38/-5)
	Quizzacious could mean one of 2 things:
	
	1. To do something in a mocking or satirical manor, such as Alec Baldwin, who is famous for parodying current U.S. president Donald J. Trump.
	
	2. Something that [hipster kids] say to make themselves sound much smarter than they actually are, somewhat similar to Verbose Memes.
	
	It is an extremely obscure old English word that was nearly never used, until popularized by Youtube channel [Vsauce], where, in is "The [Zipf] Mystery" episode, at about 17:30 minutes in, he says that the word Quizzacious is in [the oxford dictionary], however, at the time, was only found in a book called "Elder Speak" when searched on Google. "Fittingly enough," Michael (Vsauce) remarked, "it is listed as a rare word". Since it was uncovered by Vsauce, it became a Meme in the Vsauce fanbase. Ironically enough, people often use the term Quizzacious in a Quizzacious manner.
		Example: 1.
		Person A: "Did you see [Alec] Bladwin last night?"
		Person B: "Yeah. He is very Quizzqacious, is he not?"
		Person A: "Yeah! He is great at [mocking] trump."
		
		2.

	[Quoisexual] is a broad term encompassing the experience of:
	
	Being unsure if you experience attraction or not
	Being unable to understand attraction as a concept or feeling
	Finding the concept of attraction inaccessible, inapplicable, nonsensical
	Being unable to define sexual attraction and so unable to say whether or not you experience it
	Having difficulty distinguishing sexual attraction from other types of attraction
	Struggling to find a sexual orientation that is applicable to you because attraction is too complicated or because none seem to fit
	Not experiencing sexuality, sexual orientation or sexual attraction as it is normally defined.
	
	(definition from rainbowpedia on wikia)
	
	The [quoisexual] flag is black, white, green and cyan (horizontal, in that order)
		Example: [Quoisexuality] is not the same as [questioning], and yet some idiots still claim that quoisexuals are 'just confused' and will 'understand it eventually'. No. Quoisexuals are not ' just confused' and will probably never understand it considering most of them have gone through a long process of trying to understand and have [figured] out that they can't. Go away and come back when you are better educated.

	[Medical] term.  When [a patient] gets [difficult] you have to quone them.
		Example: "We're [going] to [have to] quone this [patient]"

	(2005-04-26 +486/-268)
	A neologism coined in "The [Stakeout]" episode of the television series "Seinfeld", "quone" was a word used by Mrs. Seinfeld in a Scrabble game. It was found by Jerry to not be a real word, but [Kramer] insists that it means "to [sedate]". Whether or not this word has been adapted remains to be seen.
		Example: "This [dictionary's] no good, we need a medical dictionary! When [a patient] is difficult, you quone him." - [Kramer]

	quone  coined in an episode of the TV show, Seinfeld -noun- a non-word played in the game of Scrabble; -verb-(quone, quoned, quoning) to play a non-word in Scrabble.  
	
	Note: I've actually submitted this definition to [Hasbro] and to [Merriam Webster], the manufacturers of The Scrabble Players Dictionary. Your other definition entries are good, but obviously they cannot actually appear in any medical dictionary. However, it seems that this definition has an actual function and place in a dictionary because it describes a common real-life situation (such as "wipeout" in surfing and "[misdeal]" in cards, etc)...and there is currently no dictionary listing for the situation.
		Example: Dan: "You won that Scrabble game only because you got away with playing a quone, 'flabbergut' for 36 points!"
		
		Bob: "Hey, quoning is part of [playing Scrabble]. [Don't blame me] if you're [too chicken] to challenge such an idiotic term!"

Quora
	(2020-10-18 +755/-34)
	A platform which was once a [go-to] place for answers, but now is so riddled with [pseudo-intellectuals] that it is absolutely worthless now, and can be compared to a [dilapidated] public urinal.
		Example: I had four beers man, I need to [take a leak], is there a [quora] [around here], somewhere?

	(2021-07-31 +213/-13)
	A shitty website where idiots ask stupid questions and get [likewise] stupid and long-winded [answers] about what is considered "appropriate" by people [claiming] authority.
		Example: To get the [gist] of Quora,
		
		"Is it rude to interrupt people?"
		
		"Well, according to the research conducted by Phillip Samuel [Carruthers] ([Ph.D].) in 2017 at [Cambridge University], in an experiment to assess social acceptability vs. impoliteness, it was ultimately determined that interrupting a conversation without saying a proper "Excuse me" or "Pardon me", or even "I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation", was considered extremely rude, offensive, and inappropriate. These three bases for trial were comprehensively compared to talking to somebody in a conversation whilst omitting a proper [conversation starter]. In some cases, people actually indicated that speaking without this proper introduction was "very rude", often with anger elicited as the conditioned response. In all four potential trials, the question was "Do you enjoy purple?".
		
		Personally, as a member of Politeness International (1987), as well as the Societal Center for Advancement of Manners (SCAM) (2003), I would absolutely say that interrupting any conversation PERIOD is a major violation of social norms in any society, and it should never be tolerated, as it is very inappropriate. If anybody even considers interrupting your conversation, always either ignore them, or say "Please, I'm having a conversation as you can see. Thank you."

	(2020-08-23 +399/-30)
	A site once good a filled with [smart people] who actually knew what they where talking about.

Not to mention, it won't take you long to find someone with a serious mental illness, but it WILL ultimately make you question your humanity and your sanity. In the end, it's not that bad, but don't be surprised by the horrible people you'll find in no time.
		Example: Billy: Should I use [Quora] or Yaho-
		[Quoran]: OKAY, SERIOUSLY, [QUORA] IS A FAR SUPERIOR SOURCE, AND CAN AND WILL SOLVE ALL OF YOUR PROBLEMS, SO YOUR OPINION IS COMPLETELY INNAPROPRIET AND IRRELEVANT BECAUSE [MY IQ] IS ALSO 150 SO -(etc..)

QUOTE UNQUOTE
	(2010-09-19 +162/-56)
	The paired words which PRECEDE and FOLLOW a quotation, as a kind of punctuation, orally representing the words for punctuation marks " ... "
	
	While "Quote ... endquote" appears more logical, it is in fact the word "[unquote]" which appears at the end of a direct quotation, according to The [Merriam-Webster dictionary], and [Fowler's] Modern English Usage (a British publication). Neither The [Merriam-Webster Dictionary] nor Fowler's Modern English Usage lists or recognizes the single word "quote" END QUOTE "unquote", but Fowler's Modern English Usage does indicate that "unquote" appears in the Oxford English Dictionary.
		Example: A relevant and contemporary example:
		There is no such thing as a QUOTE [secret Muslim] [UNQUOTE].
		Muslims OPENLY proclaim their Muslim faith when they say in Arabic QUOTE ash hadu an La illaha ill Allah wa Muhammadan Ras [Ullu] UNQUOTE. To deny or hide their faith is rather QUOTE not to be a Muslim UNQUOTE.
		The widely used expression "Quote [Unquote]" is a colloquial expression which does not justify its incorrect use in that form, since the two words should be separated by some kind of word, phrase or sentence, a quotation, but is evidence that language is constantly evolving, as with the word "gay", whose primary meaning today is totally different than it was 50 years ago.

	(2006-12-09 +820/-502)
	A horribly incorrect way of citing a particular phrase or adding emphasis to a questionable term. Typically it preceeds the phrase and is accompanied by a stupid little [fang] finger gesture. If you currently use the term "quote unquote" (and especially if you do the finger thing) please stop it now. Don't feel bad. It's an understandable mistake because [the idiots] on Fox News say it all the time as does your boss at work, most probably. But read on...
	
	First of all, it should be QUOTE and ENDQUOTE. These are the official names for the double [apostrophe] symbols (") on your keyboard.
	
	Secondly, the proper [syntax] is to say QUOTE, followed by the phrase, closed by ENDQUOTE.
	
	CORRECT USAGE (spoken):
	What do you think of [Bush's] quote [War on Terror] endquote?
	
	means:
	What do you think of Bush's "War on Terror?"
	
	INCORRECT USAGE (spoken):
	What do you think of Bush's quote unquote War on Terror?
	
	means:
	What do you think of Bush's ""War on Terror?
	
	Get it? Good. But try to avoid saying it altogether. Using the phrase "so-called" is much more acceptable. Example:
	What do you think of Bush's so-called War on Terror?
		Example: (Incorrect but common usage)
		BOSS: Ok people, let's get [proactive]. This is a [win-win situation]. So give it 110% and quote unquote kick some ass!
		EMPLOYEE: Man, you're such a [putz].

	(2004-06-07 +80/-95)
	Synonomous with: [supposedly], [presumably].  Used in conversation to indicate that [quotes] should be placed around the following word or phrase.
	
	quote unquote work = "work"
		Example: I quote unquote [work on] [Fridays].

	(2017-03-22 +11/-18)
	[Quote unquote] was an improper usage of quotation marks. When you quote somebody, you have a quote and an endquote, a.k.a., "[Unquote]," but sometimes people will just say [quote unquote]. And I'm gonna say, if you do the quote thing with your fingers, stop it now. That's not how it works.
	
	Anyhow, quote unquote, [why are you reading this]?
		Example: For example,
		
		[Nancy] said, quote unquote We will be leaving for [Arizona] tomorrow morning. ( [Incorrect] )
		
		Nancy said, "We will be leaving for Arizona tomorrow morning." ( Correct )

_____

quoted for truth
	(2007-11-04 +113/-18)

		Example: "[This guy] is a [moron]."
		[Quoted for truth].

	qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm is the [exact] opposite of [mnbvcxzlkjhgfdsapoiuytrewq], [whereas] the one can’t exist without the other.
		Example: This phenomenon will always remain constant for [data entry] keyboards with the QWERTY [layout] (hence the name ‘QWERTY keyboards’). This is true to the same extent that that DEATH is the opposite of LIFE, yet the one can’t occur without the other since both are linked and the one always follows the other. The one actually depends on the other and can’t exist without the existence of the other. Therefore qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm will always be the opposite of [mnbvcxzlkjhgfdsapoiuytrewq]. Unless the standard keyboard layout changes to something in the line of werqytuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm to which the opposite will then be mnbvcxzlkjhgfdsapoiutyqrew. Should this happen, then a standard data entry keyboard will not be known as a ‘QWERTY keyboard’, anymore, but rather a ‘[WERQYT] keyboard’. If you were to then pronounce the first six letters of the new keyboard layout then linguistically it would sound the same as when pronouncing ‘WORK-IT’, which is coincidentally what you should be doing at the office instead of reading all this nonsense....

You then decided to type the whole thing again but with caps lock on because it seemed more important than the test you were supposed to be studying for worth 50% of your grade. You then spent the next 3 hours contemplating what you were doing with your life, and fell asleep once you were done. The next day you failed your test and had to retake the class next year. You now work cleaning porta-potties and suffer from PTSD remembering the day everything went wrong. You typed it in again today trying to remember the feeling of happiness you had right before you hit [the enter key].

qwop
	(2008-11-19 +1724/-340)
	[QWOP](pronounced [KWOP]) is a south African olympian runner whos low IQ technically qualifies him as mentally retarded. He is, however, not required to participate in the special olympics. QWOP is known for his persistance. Due to his low IQ, he doesnt have full control of his motor functions, therefore he can usually only move about .5 meters before falling over(source, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QWOP). Despite this handicap, QWOP refuses to use a wheel chair. Atleast... thats what we think. QWOP is unable to form coherent sentences, but due to his facial expression(s) it is assumed that he doesnt want a wheel chair. 
	
	In 2002, a study by the [Pennsylvania state university] on QWOP determined that his IQ is comparable to that of a 2 year old... rat.
	
	QWOP has gained a cult following over the years. His people are very supportive. Fans have created a flash game in his honor hosted at [Foddy].net. It is used to help mentally retarded people procrastinate.
		Example: [QWOP] is [going] to [win] this time!

	(2011-12-14 +28/-13)
	V. A [method] of walking involving [uncoordinated] and [sporadic] movements, often resulting in head injuries and concussions.
		Example: "I saw him qwop [across the street] yesterday. It was quite funny to watch until his head [split] open on the [pavement]."

	(2011-01-11 +28/-25)
	(verb) - to stumble or slip with the legs swaying upward.
	
	From the flash game [QWOP], where the player controls the legs and [gait] of an olympic [sprinter], with the sprinter stumbles down most of the time with inhuman leg position.
		Example: He was so drunk that night that as he gets [in the bathtub], he qwopped down and had his skull and [limbs] [fractured].

	(2009-01-16 +34/-67)
	A flash-based [game] that simulates [running] in [the Olympics]
		Example: "Dude, I was just playing qwop"
		"Really? What was [your best]?"
		"Only 50 m. but I'm trying to [get it] [higher]".

	[Title] that you give to someone that [leaves] [unannounced] on multiple occasions.

	(2011-11-22 +18/-1)
	[QWOP] is the slang term for a computer game where you use the Q, W, O, and P keys to make a runner jog down a track. It got popular because of how stupid [the runner] looked while running and how difficult it was to get a high score. [Qwopping] can now mean either playing the video game or running in a style similar to the runner in the game.
		Example: Did you see [Matt] qwopping down [the hall]? He almost [ran] me over.

	(2010-12-07 +595/-241)
	QWOP is a simple [flash game] where kids can play, laugh and have fun with while learning the basics about the body and what it is capable of. It's very educating, and it'll make children understand how to run properly when they grow older.
	
	We suggest parents to show this wonderful game to any little girl or boy they may think might want to run the Olympics someday.
	
	The name "QWOP" is from the fact that you only need the keyboard letters Q, W, O and P to play.
	
	(Note: The author of this post has been taking [lithium] after going in complete depression after playing QWOP. Side effects to this game may not vary. All reactions have been proven the same: an urge to hit a baby, having blue vision, eating their own shit, having uncontrollable periods {both male and female}, listening to static in a bright [red room] and/or randomly yelling at their [neighbor's] wall asking for [a Twinkie]. See a doctor if any child has these symptoms or if they start having other strange behavior after one minute of playing this flash game.)
		Example: QWOP is a game [Chuck Norris] [can't even] [win].

	(2011-08-27 +79/-29)
	A game that seems insanely hard, however it can be won with [relative ease] by pressing O and W at the beginning so that your runner looks like he's doing the splits, after that press Q and W alternating to move the runner forward; the way he runs will look stupid if you use this strategy and progress will be slow, but it is relatively easy to finish if you use this strategy (however, the [hurdle] at 50 m can be a little tricky and may take some [trial and error] to get past).
		Example: Guy 1: I just beat QWOP bitches!!!
		
		Guy 2: You must be GOD!
		
		Guy 1: Actually, it only took me a few tries, it's actually not that hard. All you have to do is get QWOP to do [the splits] and alternate between Q and W, although the [hurdle] at 50 metres can be a bit [tricky].

	(2011-02-28 +43/-14)
	To fall over when [trying to walk] normally. This is caused when you walk [to fast] and trip on yourself, or just generally f**k up [a step].

		I [tripped] Johnny up on the street, and he was qwopping all the way down!

		Example: Did you see [Matt] qwopping down [the hall]? He almost [ran] me over.

	QWOP is a simple [flash game] where kids can play, laugh and have fun with while learning the basics about the body and what it is capable of. It's very educating, and it'll make children understand how to run properly when they grow older.
	
	We suggest parents to show this wonderful game to any little girl or boy they may think might want to run the Olympics someday.
	
	The name "QWOP" is from the fact that you only need the keyboard letters Q, W, O and P to play.
	
	(Note: The author of this post has been taking [lithium] after going in complete depression after playing QWOP. Side effects to this game may not vary. All reactions have been proven the same: an urge to hit a baby, having blue vision, eating their own shit, having uncontrollable periods {both male and female}, listening to static in a bright [red room] and/or randomly yelling at their [neighbor's] wall asking for [a Twinkie]. See a doctor if any child has these symptoms or if they start having other strange behavior after one minute of playing this flash game.)
		Example: QWOP is a game [Chuck Norris] [can't even] [win].

	(2011-08-27 +79/-29)
	A game that seems insanely hard, however it can be won with [relative ease] by pressing O and W at the beginning so that your runner looks like he's doing the splits, after that press Q and W alternating to move the runner forward; the way he runs will look stupid if you use this strategy and progress will be slow, but it is relatively easy to finish if you use this strategy (however, the [hurdle] at 50 m can be a little tricky and may take some [trial and error] to get past).
		Example: Guy 1: I just beat QWOP bitches!!!
		
		Guy 2: You must be GOD!
		
		Guy 1: Actually, it only took me a few tries, it's actually not that hard. All you have to do is get QWOP to do [the splits] and alternate between Q and W, although the [hurdle] at 50 metres can be a bit [tricky].

	To fall over when [trying to walk] normally. This is caused when you walk [to fast] and trip on yourself, or just generally f**k up [a step].

		I [tripped] Johnny up on the street, and he was qwopping all the way down!

QWOT
	(2009-05-21 +98/-22)
	An internet site created from the ruins of [AWOT] after [AudiWorld] management sold out to [Internet Brands] and subsequently converted from the beloved KAWF software to the much maligned vB software in direct opposition to the will of its members.
	
	This will go down in history as one of the biggest mass-exodus of a forum membership to a competing forum in the history of the internet. This was a direct result of Internet Brands and AudiWorld management failure to understand the appeal of their existing product. This is a classic definition of management arrogance triumphing over the ability of a membership to vote with their feet.
		Example: QWOT [is the new] [AWOT].

	(2009-03-18 +238/-91)
	[Rule #1]. There is no QWOT

	(2015-04-12 +464/-90)
	A typed emoticon (face) expressing crying, often in a semi-serious or comical sense. [The Q's] are the eyes with tears streaming out and the W is a squiggly mouth. It's related to other crying faces that use Q's for eyes, such as [Q.Q] [q.q] or simply QQ. It is used both with capitals ([QwQ] or [QWQ]) and without ([qwq]) to mean the same thing.
		Example: Sol: "Let's see what food we have in the kitchen."
		[Neptune]: "omg [QwQ] all my pasta is gone..."
		
		or
		
		[Sidarth]: "Did you win 3 rounds yet?"
		Xerxus: "No... I lost them all [qwq]"

	(2007-06-14 +286/-152)
	"What does [qwq] mean?" qwq was developed in [quantum physics] labs deep underground in Germany. In English, 'qwq' means simply.. 'qwq'. No hidden meanings. But in Korean, 'qwq' has been [clinically proven] to mean "NOT EVEN DEATH CAN SAVE YOU FROM ME." This discovery was found after the invention of 'qwq', so we try not to focus on this. Laughing out loud? No you're not. You're just typing it. Anyone who commonly says 'lol' is a liar! You are not laughing out loud. You are just to lazy to type anything else. We're here to fix that.
