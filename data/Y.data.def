y chromosome
	(2004-01-31 +156/-46)
	[Male] [Sex] [Chromosome]
		Example: Scientists have discovered that [the Y chromosome] uses a neat trick to repair its most crucial genes, a strategy that apparently helps keep it from [rotting away] over evolutionary time.
		
		Instead of [doubling up] to protect its genetic cargo like other chromosomes, the lone Y safeguards its genes by having sex with itself, an international [consortium] has found. Proving perhaps that nature has a sense of humor, scientists have discovered that the Y chromosome - the one that makes a man a man - has a remarkable ability to make do-it-yourself repairs.
		
		[June 20], 2003 — The human male sex chromosome does have the ability to repair itself and may not be headed for extinction as had previously been thought, according to a surprising new study.
		
		A 40-strong team of researchers led by David Page of [the Whitehead] Institute at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, report their findings in this week's issue of the journal Nature. 
		
		As well as having a previously unknown and elaborate back-up system for self-repair, the Y chromosome also carries 78 genes.
		
		
		
		
		"[The Y chromosome] is a [hall of mirrors]," said Page, whose team has for the first time identified the full genetic sequence of a [Y chromosome], from an anonymous donor.
		
		Both the male Y and female X chromosomes are thought to have originally been the same size, but after the Y took on the sex-determining role for maleness it apparently began to lose genes. At this time it also lost the ability to pair up exactly with its partner and to swap faulty genes for good ones, as the other 22 pairs of non-sex chromosomes do. 
		
		Earlier studies had suggested that the Y chromosome carried only a few dozen genes, compared with more than 1,000 known on the X chromosome. 
		
		A team of Australian researchers led by Jenny Graves, of the Research School of Biological Sciences at the Australian National University in Canberra, previously found that the Y chromosome had been losing five genes per million years. Graves had thus predicted that the chromosome might be heading for extinction within five to 10 million years.
		
		But Page said that the [Y's] full [genome] sequence has revealed that scientists generally had underestimated both its number of genes and its powers of self-preservation.
		
		The team believes the Y has developed an apparently unique way of pairing up with itself. They found that many of its 50 million DNA "letters" occur in sequences known as [palindromes]. Like their grammatical counterparts, these sequences of letters read the same forward as backward but are arranged in opposite directions — like a mirror image — on both strands of the DNA [double helix]. This means that a back-up copy of each of the genes they contain occurs at each end of the sequence. 
		
		When the DNA divides during reproduction, the team believes, it opens an opportunity for genes to be shuffled or swapped and faulty copies to be deleted.

	(2006-10-21 +27/-17)
	[The Y chromosome] is one of the two sex chromosomes (X and Y). Only men carry [the Y chromosome]. The Y chromosome is male specific, passing from father [to son]. It is responsible for many male characteristics.
		Example: The path of evolution is usually so quirky and complex that scientists shy away from making predictions. But the future of [the Y chromosome] seems clear. Graves points out that, on average, three to six genes have disappeared from the Y every million years since the chromosome emerged. At that rate, the Y has only 10 million years left. It's an old chromosome, [at death's door].
		
		The death of the Y doesn't mean the death of men. Men need only look to the mole [vole] for comfort. Burrowing through the soil of western Asia are two species of these rodents (Ellobius tancrei and E. lutescens) that have lost all the genes from their Y chromosome--in fact, they no longer have a [Y chromosome] at all. In one of these species, both males and females have been left with just the [unpaired] X; in the other, both sexes have two X's. No one knows how mole voles ended up being the first mammals to cross over into the Y-free future. But along the way, they must have evolved new genes--on other chromosomes--that are responsible for making males. One of those genes took over the job of SRY, and the chromosome on which it resides is probably on its way to becoming the new Y.
		
		If our species manages to survive for another 10 million years, our descendants will go on making men even after their Y chromosome vanishes. But the change may not [be smooth]. Graves speculates that several new systems for determining sex could emerge within the global human population. People conceived under one system might be genetically incompatible with those conceived under others. As a result, the human species could fragment into separate populations and, ultimately, separate species. Which of them will prefer football and which [the ant] nest, we'll have to [wait and see].

	(disregard my definition above)
	
	Chromosome which is found in males. XY = male. XX = female. Sperm can be either an X or [Y chromosome]. During [fertilization], if [the Y chromosome] sperm reaches the egg, then the baby is a boy. If the X chromosome sperm reaches the egg, then the baby is a girl.
		Example: If [the Y chromosome] is going extinct within the next 10-50 million years, then (assuming humans will still be around) where the fuck will babies come from?! Women (XX genes) can't have babies by themselves. They need a man (XY genes). That makes no fucking sense. [Third sex]? [XZ]? WTF?

	(2004-08-11 +1410/-435)

		Example: Where are y'all [going]?

	(2005-09-26 +915/-372)
	contraction for you all.  Despite what some think, it is not only used by [hicks] and the [uneducated].  People from [all walks of life], traditionally the southern states use it.

	Very common in the South, it is rare to find someone (excluding Florida, and that's only because of all the Yankees down there) that doesn't use [y'all].
	
	Saying y'all makes so much more sense than the ever-popular you guys, [you guyses], or even you all. It is much shorter and gets the point across much faster. And takes less breath.
	
	It is never ya'll. The ['a'] is not a part of you, it's a part of all (you wouldn't [spell it out] as [youa] ll, would you?).

		Greg: Chris and I are [going to the movies]. We're seeing *insert [good movie] here*

Also, don't let the ignorant country nigas from out here confuse you into thinking that "[West Willow]" or the "South side" are rough and hard areas because they arent. They are two neighborhoods that are literally 1 mile from each other in a small town that has a 7 mile radius, and they beef over absolutely nothing. Most cats from Ypsilanti really convince themselves to be hard because they wear new J's and sell nickel and dime sacks on the corner, but they really a sons and daughters of middle to upper-middle class folks, who go to good schools, and are spoiled as hell. Ypsilanti locals suffer from a "Small town Complex" which is the same concept as a "Napoleon Complex" except it not about a persons height, but the mentality of the town. Most Ypsilanti locals will lie and tell people they are from Detroit, only to compensate for the fact that Ypsilanti is lame and full of simple ass people, but the truth comes to light when the difference in Detroit swag and Ypsilanti followism is apparent.
		Example: Detroit dude: Whats good man, where you from?
		
		[Ypsilanti] dude: Im from [West Willow] Baby!!
		
		Detroit dude: What the fuck is a West Willow?
		
		Ypsilanti dude: Nigga, its out there in y town where we doin the damn thing out there my nigga!!
		
		Detroit dude: What the Fuck is y town?
		
		Ypsilanti dude: Ypsilanti my dude. . . . . . Right there next the [Ann Arbor] my nigga.
		
		Detroit dude: I dont know what the fuck you talkin bout, with yo simple ass.

Y-Wing
	(2005-08-05 +71/-20)
	Noun: Any exceptionally large "[camel-toe]" or overly large labias on a human female. Usually caused by a combination of excessive sexual intercourse, vaginal [mutilation], wearing tight pants with no underwear or wearing a [g-string] 2+ sizes too small.

	(2004-07-24 +85/-33)
	Despite its age, the ship has been one of the mainstays of the Rebel Alliance and saw notable duty at the Battle of Yavin, during which the Imperial Death Star was destroyed. Prior to the introduction of the [X-wing] [starfighter], Y-wings were the flagship fighters of the Alliance. The twin-engine [Y-wing], at sixteen meters long, is a multipurpose ship that was originally designed as a compromise between a full-fledged attack fighter and a heavier bomber. The durable starfighter can give and take a great deal of punishment, but they don't have the payload capacity or the speed, stealth, and the maneuverability to compete with modern Imperial attack fighters. The Rebel Alliance has flown more Y-wings than any other fighter and has used a number of different configuration for a variety of mission profiles. It isn't uncommon for a Y-wing to be stripped down for assault runs against Imperial convoys and then be refitted by rebel technicians for a heavy [bombing run] against an imperial base. Y-wings also find use on diplomatic escort missions and for long-range patrols. The BTL-A4 Y-wing (LP), or Long-Probe-Class, has extra provisions, more powerful sensors, and a sophisticated navigation computer specifically for patrol duty. The Y-wing has three main components. The forward cockpit module houses the pilots and weaopons systems. A reinforced space-frame central spar stretches back from the cockpit module; the [Y-wing's] ionization reactor and [hyperdrive]/astrogation hardware are crammed into this narrow frame. A cross wing housing the main power cells ataches at the back of the spar, with the two powerful sublight ion drives on either end. The cockpit module has thick armor plating. The pilot controls a pair of forward laser cannons and twin [proton torpedo] launchers. A turret-mounted [ion cannon] is directly behind the pilot. Like the X-wing, an R2 or [R4] astromech droid fits snugly into [the droid] socket behind the cockpit and monitors all fight, navigation, and power systems. [The droid] can also handle fire control, perform simple inflight maintenance, and reroute power as needed. The R2 unit also stores hyperspace jump coordinates.
		Example: WOW, I must really be [a nerd] [to know] [all that]!!

		Example: Check out all [my Star] [Wars] [definitions]!

	(2004-12-10 +16/-12)
	Growing increasingly outdated with the advent of [sleeker], more powerful starfighters, the [Y-wing] nonetheless has a proud track record of service in the Rebel Alliance. The sturdy fighter-bomber gets its name from its shape: a reinforced central spar connects the cockpit to a cross-spar. At each end of the cross-spar rests a powerful engine nacelle, which houses the fighter's sublight and [hyperdrive] engines. Just aft of the cockpit module is the astromech droid socket.
	
	The [Y-wing's] primary weapons are twin forward-firing laser cannons, housed in a recessed slot in the front of the cockpit module. A secondary weapon is a turret mounted paired set of cannons. Though many Y-wings fly as single-pilot fighters, some sport a two-seat configuration with a rear-facing [tailgunner] operating the turret canons.
	
	The Y-wing also carries [proton torpedo] launchers. During the Battles of Yavin and Endor, Y-wing squadrons were influential in helping defeat the Death Star threats. A Y-wing brandishes its squadron colors and markings on its main cockpit module and the forward tips of the engine nacelles.

	A good way to tell who a ya d00d might be is during online communication. When asked a [yes or no question], if the answer is yes, they will most likely reply "ya d00d". In certain cases, a ya d00d might actually replace all [the o's] in a sentence with a zero instead. Ya [d00ds] often consume a lot of alcohol, and will talk about the act more than they actually do it. A standard ya d00d will not shut up about how often he gets drunk, or how often he smokes marijuana.
	
	If at all possible, try to avoid any ya d00d you may see. They are a hazard to the general public, a danger to your mentality, and overall are just fucking awful. The term can be heard in a line from the song "Those Kids Suck" by [Big D and the Kids Table], where he says, "I'd rather be called nuts than to be a ya d00d."

		Person 3: Yeah, to be honest, if he didn't have that much beer, he probably wouldn't have many friends. Nobody likes ya [d00ds].
		
		ya d00d: [w0w] d00d ur n0t [c00l] mayne
		Rational person: Shut the fuck up.
		
		Person A: Why does he have such a hot girlfriend? He's a total ya d00d.

Yahoo answers
	(2007-04-05 +1992/-213)
	A useful novelty created by Yahoo that was designed for those who are curious about the things in this world but are too afraid to ask.  Also, this allows people to share their knowledge with the rest of the world.  Unfortunately, after [December 19], 2006, the day the message boards died, trolls now need a new home, so it looks like [Yahoo Answers] are about to be [hijacked] by ignorant trolls.
		Example: Typical questions found on [Yahoo Answers] BEFORE [Dec 19], 2006:
		
		How do I cook [Korean food]?
		What is the best way to speak French fluently?
		Who will win the Super Bowl?
		
		Typical questions found on Yahoo Answers AFTER Dec 19, 2006:
		
		Which website has the best gay asian porn?
		Why do negro people smell like gorilla feces?
		If I look at me sister and I get an erection, will I go to hell?
		

	(2010-11-03 +338/-39)
	A website with a userbase comprised largely of some of the dumbest and laziest retards ever to walk the planet. Most are people who can somehow figure out how to use [Y!A] to post questions, but can't figure out even the most basic aspects of a search engine. Others want you to do their homework for them. Still more ask questions about policies of certain companies that could've been solved faster if they'd just gone to said website or picked up a phone. Many are largely unintelligible with spelling, punctuation, and grammar that would make an English professor [weep]. There are [angsty teens], clueless middle-aged people, and [senile] old people. While some people ask specific and smart questions, the vast majority of posts are asked by people who can't even figure out how to figure something out themselves. The same applies to answers. Some are insightful and useful, but most are just idiocy.
	
	Essentially, it's a site where retards can ask retarded questions and get answers from other retards. It's a horrifying look into what happens when technology puts evolution in reverse and allows people who would have been culled from [the herd] long ago to survive and [procreate]. If ever you want to see the [abysmal], [stygian] depths of human stupidity, look no further than Yahoo Answers.
		Example: [Idiot]? That guy is [Yahoo] Answers-grade [stupid]!

	(2013-02-10 +129/-13)
	A question and answer website home to some of the biggest retards ever, besides maybe [YouTube comments]. You can get reported there for breathing. Half of the questions and responses are unintelligible from grammatical errors. Filled with racists, ignorant morons, religious extremists, and people who were apparently taught English by newborn [orangutans].
	
	A message board [gone to hell].
		Example: Typical Yahoo Answers Question
		
		i is 15, [shud] i havs [babie]?
		
		Answer 1: no you is two young for baby. you need to grow up
		Answer 2: i am 17 and has baby. people tell me it was bad idea but i dont regret it
		Answer 3: all teens is so stupuid. i is smart and i is 19. you are stupid i hopes you die. [dumb b]*tch

	(2011-07-02 +90/-10)
	"Yahoo! Answers" is Yahoo! [Inc.'s] solution to the average person's unformatted search engine questions. It allows Yahoo! E-Mail holders to ask any number of pointed questions, such as, "What is wrong with my vagina?" or "How can we stop [Jaden Smith]?" as well as, "Who is the President of France?" and, "No seriously, wtf is wrong with my vagina?"
	
	Users can then receive answers from Yahoo! E-Mail "point seekers" - a special brand of people who try to answer as many questions as possible, then voting their own questions as the "Best Answer" in order to gain a delusive sense of Yahoo! [internetz] [seniority]. Because of an unparalleled level of quality control in the review of questions, users can generally expect their questions to be answered incorrectly or - with luck - answered unintelligibly.
		Example: "Yahoo! Answers" Question: What steps can I take to fix my own cell phone?
		
		Best Answer - [Chosen by Voters]: Why bother? Throw that sh*t out and get a new one! Problem solved, bitch. [Next question]!
		100% [1 Vote]

	(2008-10-15 +896/-142)
	1) The absolute best fucking place [to troll]; at home, at work, and especially during classes that allow unmonitored internet access.
	
	2) Home of some of the most idiotic, [ignorant people] on the face of the earth. Almost everyone on the site will believe just about anything you post.
	
	3) The hardest place NOT to be suspended from.
	
	4) A great place to get some of the worst information on the web. Most of the people have nothing else better to do and just  answer for points.
	
	5) Home of the most bitchy [pregnant women] that you will ever come in contact with.
		Example: Troll #1: I'm getting my sixth abortion in ten years -- will you say a prayer for me?
		
		Troll #2: Help! [My 11] year old son just got his period?!?
		
		Brainwashed [religious nut] #1: I had a dream that I killed Mariah [Carrey]. Will God send me to hell?
		
		Guy: What do you like to do for fun?
		
		Girl: I spend all my time on yahoo answers. It's even more fun than myspace.
		
		Guy: Don't you have anything better to do?
		
		Girl: Actually, I don't.

	(2012-12-31 +30/-2)
	Formally a very good website but it has gone totally to shit.
	
	Whoever owns the website has obviously gave up maintaining it.
	
	False reporting runs VERY FREQUENT, especially in the Others-Cultures&Groups and [Polls]&[Survey] area. When you appeal a report then you NEVER get a response back on whether it was appealed or not (you used to get a response within a couple days).
	
	Plus, there are constantly glitches on the site (a new unique crazy [glitch] every time), those are eventually fixed after the site [not working] properly for days after each new glitch pops up.
	
	It's just trash now and a lot of people are leaving it
		Example: Yahoo Answers needs to get their fucking act together because people are leaving, including me. If their too [fucking lazy] to give a shit then at least sell [the site] to somebody who will give it attention. [Damn shame].

	(2011-01-30 +140/-21)
	Site where some people come to ask serious questions and where some come to troll. Here are the types of people on this site.
	
	[Spammers]: People who spam links to other websites.
	
	Teenage girls: Most of them ask stupid questions.
	
	Teenage guys: Most of them give stupid answers.
	
	Trolls: Most ask racist questions.
	
	Angry young women: Annoying people who rant at you for asking a reasonable question.
	
	Angry young men: Annoying people who find it necessary to ask you a question in your question. (even if it has nothing to do with your question)
	
	Creepy men: Most have [the avatar] with the guys that have [squinty eyes] and long hair and a big smile. They say perverted things to you.
	
	People who shouldn't answer: People who answer for the points. They say things like "I'd like to know that too" or "I don't know"
	
	People who don't answer/read the question (self explanatory.)
	
	Then there are normal people
	
	There is NO WAY to appeal to a report you get in your inbox, and so the only way to not get reported for sure is to not say anything at all.
	
	PS- it is also funny as hell to get some [idiot's] [account deleted].
		Example: Yahoo answers community sucks
		Spammer: I just got a good deal on a laptop! I wasn't able to afford it at first because I couldn't find a good job, but I saved $150!! www.cheapstufffss.com!
		
		Teenage girls: Q: OMG me n this guy had sex last night and I'm afraid I could be prgnant! [HELPP]!!!
		A: i dont kno maybbe he lieek askd u out cuz he thot u wax [cuul].
		
		Teenage guys: Q: Is my penis small if it is 2 inches? Will I grow? I am only 15?
		A: I would date you! [email me] at tomsuyfies@ehean.net! or Hey I'd show you the time of my life girl with my 13 inch!
		
		Troll: Q: Why do black people like chicken? Is it in their dna?
		A: All white people like mayo cuz their racist!
		Angry young women: ex) Why do people like to suck up to popular people?
		Their answer: [The world doesn't revolve around you] you know. maybe people would like you if would stop being so self-centered! (answer the question, dumbass.)
		Angry young men: ex) Why do people make each other jealous?
		A: Why do women feel the need to make us jealous? Why do women wear slutty outfits and expect us not to look? We'll never know the answer to your question.
		Creepy men: Hey babe, I think your hot and [I'd tap] dat @$$! (avatar goes: <;D)
		People who don't answer/read the question: Q: How do I make chili?
		A: I personally like salads more than chili. (Who gives a fuck??)

	(2012-11-09 +36/-4)
	Pretty good and active site overall. Good place to burn time or troll. You CAN get good quality answers
	
	FAMOUS SECTIONS:
	Polls and Surveys ([P&S]): Jampacked place where braindead teens and preteens congregate and leave one-word answers. Dumbest section on the site which is why they don't [give Top] Contributor badges there.
	
	Others-Cultures and Groups (OC&G): Place filled with closet-racists who got dumped by a chick of insert race here and go to [Y/A] to vent as well as Report Rats who get pissed off at the slight mention of race (even though they're in the race section). Most people whine about the racism but at the same time feed into the trolls. Lots of [cloning] too and mentally ill people who post repetitive questions.
	
	LGBT: The most sensitive section out there. Lots of [anti-gay] trolls and "transgendered women" who go off when you call them transexuals or trans. Can't forget about the insecure ppl asking TOTAL STRANGERS whether THEMSELVES are gay or not
	
	Politics: Tense place filled with over-sensitive losers who [dehumanize] each other based on politics beliefs. Also a lot of racists. Lots of self-righteous idiots.
	
	Adolescent: Section designed for adults but filled with whiny teens asking if they're pregnant and other [stupidness] like wanting to have a baby despite never having a job or being in the [10th grade].
	
	[Gender Studies]: Filled with annoying feminist lesbians and guys with tiny dicks who bash them to compensate for their demasculinization.
		Example: Bob: Let's ask an innocent question about [flowers] on [Yahoo] Answers
		Computer: Your question has been [reported] by the Yahoo! Community

	(2013-03-26 +21/-2)
	[The next] attempt to [eliminate] [Google].
		Example: Tom asked "How do I beat Slender?" on [Yahoo Answers], and it took a whole day for him to get a answer, and most of them were sarcasm stupidity. I [googled] it and went straight to www.[google.com] while he had to wait for a week for some (sarcasm)"good"(sarcasm) answers.

Yahoo Answers Trolls
	(2011-05-18 +75/-14)
	A Yahoo Answer trolls is usually someone who enjoys to annoy everyone else on Yahoo Answers (but some aren't like that). The Yahoo Answers Trolls are usually found in the [Polls & Surveys] category but they sometimes venture into other categories. But there are many types of Yahoo Answers Trolls.
	[The Scroll] Troll: A troll who loves to create an incredibly long answer so you cannot see the other answers without scrolling down the screen for at least 5 minutes. The smart thing to do when you see a [scroll troll] is to thumb them down.
	The Reporter Trolls: Reports innocent questions and answers that are not angianst the community guidelines just for fun.
	Spam Troll: A troll who always asks the same question or always answers with the same answer.
	Funny Trolls: Trolls that make the Yahoo Answers users laugh. Unlike the other trolls, these trolls are actually liked by most of the Yahoo users.
		Example: Person 1: Do you go on [Yahoo Answers]?
		Person 2: Yea, but its [invaded] with [trolls]!
		Person 1: That sucks
		Person 2: I know! Yahoo Answers [Trolls] are so annoying!

	(2011-02-24 +36/-8)
	First, [Yahoo Answers] used to be an educational site to ask and answer questions. Now, there's trolls on it. If you use Yahoo Answers and are not a noob or a Top Contributor, you're most likely a troll. Trolls are [smartass] people who usually tell [inside jokes].
		Example: Answer of a Yahoo Answers Troll:
		
		Q: "What's the best movie?"
		
		Troll A: "[CHUCK NORRIS] IS [LIKE SO] [OVERRATED] OMG"

	(2015-02-15 +11/-2)
	A [Yahoo Answers] Troll is a troll that lurks on Yahoo Answers and does all kinds of things. They always break the Yahoo Answers [Community Guidelines]. It is highly recommended that you report any kind of troll. Most, if not all, [trolls] will use the 'Anonymous' feature so that they wont get blocked and/or reported. Well you can report their answers and questions but what I mean by 'report' is reporting their account to Yahoo Answers Team. The anonymous feature is there so that legit users can use it if they are not ok with showing their name when asking a question or answering one. But unfortunately, the trolls abuse that feature. Any troll that uses the anonymous feature will forever be a coward. You will find trolls mostly on the [Polls & Surveys] section. But you could find trolls in other sections as well. There are different types of trolls on Yahoo Answers. Here is a list of the different types of trolls:
	
	- Reporter [Trolls]: are trolls that report legitimate questions and answers just for fun.
	
	- Spam Trolls: are trolls that just spam Yahoo Answers with the same things over and over again.
	
	- Scroll Trolls: are trolls that post ridiculously long answers and you have to keep on scrolling for like a few minutes to see the other answers.
	
	- Funny Trolls: are trolls that say [funny things] on Yahoo.
	
	- Insult Trolls: are trolls that insult other users of Yahoo.
	
	- Anonymous Trolls: are trolls that go anonymous and may do all kinds of things ranging from reporting to insulting.
		Example: Yahoo Answers Troll: I feel powerful [behind the screen]. No one can [touch me] [hahahaha]

		Example: [Do you] have a [working] yahoo cracker?

_____

Yahoo Comments
	(2010-12-09 +275/-48)
	The comments that are found at the bottom of every article written by Yahoo Staff. In this section, you would expect to see feedback RELEVANT to the article that was intelligent and constructive. But like any comments section on any website these days, it is polluted by [the usual suspects]:
	
	1. [The Critic]: The person who instead of critiquing the article, attacks the writer and their abilities. Comments like these are generally common towards Yahoo writer Chris Chase.
	
	2. The Political [Nut Job]: These ones I hate the most. It is the guy/girl who turns an article that is completely unrelated to politics, and works up some conspiracy involving the article subject and one or more of the following: 9/11, George W. Bush, Obama, Republicans, Democrats, Tea Party, The Economy, Health care reform, Tax-Cuts,etc,etc...you get the idea
	
	3. The Racist: Usually tries to associate the subject matter into some form of racism (Usually involving Obama too).
	
	4. Spam: Close to 25% of [Yahoo's] comments anymore. Usually deal with date sites, crappy porno sites, etc.
	
	5. The Illegible Writer: This one is just annoying as fuck. Someone who writes a comment which could have potential, but is [marred] by the god-awful grammar. And I'm not just talking about things like using "u" instead of you.
		Example: Some typical examples of Yahoo Comments:
		
		1. The only thing worse than [this economy] is [Yahoo's] writers.
		
		2. Well its very touching that the soldier was re-united with his wife, but it would've have happened if George Bush didn't send us to Iraq. He's the true criminal in all this! He staged 9/11 and planned for our economy to fail.
		
		3. Yo man that's straight up racist man! Just another example of the white man keeping us down.
		
		4. OMG I'm like 26 years old and hot, sexy, and single. I just met this guy through www.datenow.com VERY EASY to use and you will meet your soulmate within a click of your mouse!
		
		5. liek i wuz ageein wit wut he [sayd] butt i beleeve that [tacts] cuts r [gr8t] 4 the economy

yahoo games
	(2004-09-21 +50/-15)
	1. A website filled with games such as [chess] and [pool].
	2. A good [alternative] to actually paying attention in high school.
		Example: [I remember] when the school started to block the yahoo games site, so we [learned] japanese and spanish so we could [log on] under different countries

	(2004-07-01 +13/-26)
	what [nerds] and [old people] [sit] around and play all day...
		Example: yahoo games is a good way to [fall] [asleep] if your having [trouble].

_____

Yahoo Message Boards
	(2005-03-03 +63/-6)
	One of the biggest constant flamewars outside of [Usenet]. Just comment on a news article about any thing [remotely] connected with race and/or ethnicticity and be prepared for the [flames] all night.
		Example: Most news stories on [Yahoo News] serve as [flamebait] for the [Yahoo] Message Board.

_____

yahoo messenger
	(2003-08-22 +314/-135)
	Buggy [crapware] that is used to send "instant messages" that are [queued] for several days before being delivered or possibly lost. Also known to crash if [more than three] people fart at once, and the third tuesday of every month.
		Example: [Damn], [fucking] [yahell] crahed again!

	(2008-04-18 +49/-25)
	The worst [instant messaging] service available on the face of the Earth. Known to drop messages, log-out at random times, and somehow confused with more advanced instant messaging services, such as [MSN], AIM, and/or [AOL].
		Example: Hey, I [use] [Yahoo Messenger]! [I have no life]!

	(2007-05-21 +60/-56)
	Quite possibly the worst instant messaging [protocol] to be used today (Although not quite as worse as [ICQ])
	
	I personally feel sorry for people that use Yahoo... hey [the 1990's] called, it wants it's messaging protocol back.
		Example: Hey I'm going to send a message to my friend on [Yahoo messenger]... oh wait [that's right], [all my friends] use AIM or MSN.

_____

yahoo pool
	(2005-07-14 +122/-26)
	A great pool [simulation] game on yahoo that, sadly, has become [rampant] with cheating. Better get yourself a worthy [aimer] cheat if you want to be competitive...

	(2003-07-08 +64/-64)
	Exciting online pool playing for when you are either [too high] or [cracked-out] the next day to lift a pool [cue].

		A: "Nah, I'm too fucked after all those drugs last night, I'm [jut] going to [stay at home] and play 'yahoo pool'."

Yahoo Propaganda Answers
	(2008-07-27 +153/-71)
	[Yahoo Answers] is a web site that was created with the idea of helping people find answers to their questions. While most of the time this is the case, Yahoo Answers has been turning more and more into a  Right-Wing Propaganda site. Where questions about freedom issues [like Gay] Marriage and [Atheism] are met with ignorant, mean comments and Pro-Republican ideas. [Yahoo] claims the site is "[Moderated] By The Users" but there has been complaints that questions that met all the guidelines, were deleted, with many suspecting it was because a Yahoo Employee didn't (Personally) like the question. This can be seen by making 2 different accounts and posting different questions that fall into a Conservative or Liberal mindset. Conservative questions and comments are often times left up on the site, even when they include offensive words like "Fag". While Liberal points of view are deleted, without a reason by Yahoo. Many [Christian's] use Yahoo Answers as a tool to spread their faith and views. Many questions, not even related to God, are met with answers that read like Religious Propaganda; IE: "Your leg hurts because [God loves you] and this pain will heal you! God Bless!" Criticism for Republican politicians, will be met with Republican users reporting these users to Yahoo; where Yahoo will just remove the comment and give that user a "[Violations] Notice". Yahoo claims Violations Notice can be disputed, but Yahoo rarely, if ever, replies back to the emails. MANY former Yahoo Answer users have reported that their accounts have been deleted, citing the reasons above. Considering Yahoo awards a [point system] to encourage more participation, a user with several thousand points who ends up having their account suspended, is put through a lot of [undo] stress. Seeing as it can take several months to a year to reach these point levels.
		Example: A guy asked if [Gay Marriage] was the reason for the [flooding] in the USA. If that God was punishing us. When I called his comments ignorant and that he was acting like a bigot; I received a [Violations] Notice. Even though his question remained up. Yeah, real fair..... Just another day on Yahoo Propaganda Answers !

	(2006-07-17 +191/-36)

		Example: [JOHN 5]:43, The Messiah said, "I have come in My Father's name, but, you did not recieve Me.  Another will come in his own name, and him you will recieve."
		
		"[Yeshua]" means "He saves" and was the most popular form of the name which is now commonly translated into English as "Jesus".  But, "[Yahshua]" means "Yah saves", and therefore contains the name of The Father "Yah" (Weh).  See Psalm 68:4.
		
		Compare MATTHEW 1:16 and LUKE 3:23. 

	(2006-05-20 +334/-59)

During the time between the Testaments, Judaism developed, wherein Yahweh is worshipped, but His name is not pronounced as a way to avoid saying the name in vain. Hence the Yahwistic "Yahshua [HaMashiach]" versus the Jewish "[Yeshua] HaMashiach".

Yahweh
	(2009-03-04 +230/-54)
	In the [Hebrew] [Bible], "Yahweh" is the personal name of [The Creator].
		Example: The NEW [JERUSALEM] [BIBLE] uses the name "Yahweh" throughout the Old [Testament].

	(2010-10-24 +52/-18)
	The name "Yahweh" comes from [Exodus], where God introduces himself as "I am that I am."
	
	Considered by many Protestant Christians to be a personal god. (That is, a god who desires to be a part of our every day lives.)
	
	Both a god of love, and a god of justice. Some like to [romanticize] God by limiting Him to his loving side, while others use God's justice as an excuse to oppress people. But a perfect God must love deeply, and also hate injustice.
	
	God promises that every evil act will be punished, if not in this life than in the next. But there is an escape from this.
	
	Some believe that being a good person will get you into heaven, but this this [merit system] is flawed. Certain individuals like [Mother Teresa] and Hitler could be easily placed on one side or another, but what about the ones in between?
	
	Wouldn't it suck to be the guy standing right behind where the line was cut off?
	
	"But that guy ahead of me isn't much better than me! We're practically equals!"
	
	"True, but we have to draw a line somewhere... Sorry!"
	
	God doesn't go by the credit-merit system of salvation. Instead, "All have [sinned] and fallen short of the glory of God."
	
	God says that if you want to spend all of eternity with Him, simply tell Him you're sorry for everything you've done wrong, and to love Him with Your life. Know Him personally, and you will enter.
	
	Whether you believe in Him or not, THIS is the God of the Bible. [Take it or leave it].
		Example: Matthew 25:1-13: "At that time the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their [lamps] and went out to meet the [bridegroom]. Five of them were foolish and five were wise. The foolish ones took their lamps but did not take any oil with them. The wise, however, took oil in jars along with their lamps. The bridegroom was a long time in coming, and they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
		
		"At midnight the cry rang out: 'Here's the bridegroom! Come out to meet him!'
		
		"Then all [the virgins] woke up and trimmed their lamps. The foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil; our lamps are going out.'
		
		" 'No,' they replied, 'there may not be enough for both us and you. Instead, go to those who sell oil and buy some for yourselves.'
		
		"But while they were on their way to buy the oil, the bridegroom arrived. [The virgins] who were ready went in with him to the wedding banquet. And the door was shut.
		
		"Later the others also came. 'Sir! Sir!' they said. 'Open the door for us!'
		
		"But he replied, 'I tell you the truth, [I don't know you].' "
		
		---Yahweh, as Jesus

	(2009-05-20 +103/-51)
	Yahweh [is LOVE]!
		Example: [JOHN] 3:8,
		He who does not love,
		does not know [Yahweh],
		because [YAHWEH] [IS LOVE].

	(2004-08-16 +104/-64)
	English version of the Hebrew word [YHWH], which translates into 'I am'. Jews refer to their God as Yahweh, is the same god that Christians and [Muslims] believe in. 
	
	see God/[Allah]/Jesus/YHWH
		Example: If you are writing [the Torah], and [misspell] Yahweh, the Torah needs to be ceremoniously [buried].

	(2010-10-05 +36/-33)
	The traditional Hebrew name for the [Judeo-Christian] god from the Jewish [Torah] and the Old Testament of the Christian bible.
	
	While superficially glorified by scripture, he can be characterized by his actions as one of the most supremely [douchy] characters in all of western literature and theology. A few of his more characteristic actions were the demand for genocide by his followers, the demand for his followers to kill their own children, the encouragement of slavery and subjugation of women, the demand that his followers must simultaneously love and fear him, and psychotic bets made with the devil (whom he never could be bothered to kill) at the expense of his creations. Once, in [a dick move] of the highest order, he murdered the entire population of the earth with a massive flood because he was pissed off at them for being exactly the way he made them. It should also be noted that while supposedly omnipotent, the character demonstrates an extremely neurotic personality (leading some theologians to conclude he had a [Jewish mother]). This personality can be demonstrated by his obsession with the worship and adoration of others. Today, one might think it slightly pathetic for a creator to seek validation of his own superiority from his creations, but apparently this idea never occurred to him (despite his theoretically infinite intelligence and wisdom). For all of these reasons and more we can think of him simply as a dick hole of (quite literally) [biblical proportions].
		Example: [Praying] man: "Blessed God, full of Grace"...
		[Heckler]: "What God you [praying] to there friend? Wouldn't happen to be Yahweh, would it?"
		Praying man: "Yeah, do you mind?"
		Heckler: "No, all the same to me. But you do know he is a mass-murdering psychotic dictator, right?"
		Praying Man: "That's not true, he loves us!"
		Heckler: "Like a rapist loves his victims maybe..."

	(2009-03-09 +32/-35)
	[Unbelievably awesome] or [righteous]
		Example: that was [yahweh]

	(2004-07-11 +164/-56)

yakivegas
	(2008-05-20 +56/-18)
	[Kitschy] nickname for [Yakima], Washington, a sunny agricultural-based town about 130 miles southeast of Seattle. The region produces fruit and vegetables of all kinds, including apples, peaches, cherries, potatoes, corn and most notably-grapes-as the region has become well known for it's outstanding wines over the last decade or so. Yakima county is by far the number one producer of hops in the U.S. and inspired Bert Grant to start the nation’s very first post-prohibition brew-pub, kick-starting the micro-brewery craze back in the early 1980’s. 
	
	300 days of yearly sunshine, fertile volcanic soil, its close proximity to the Cascade mountain range and the [confluence] of the [Naches], Tieton and Yakima rivers give the area ideal growing conditions and also provides damp west-siders with a sunny retreat when tasting [the region's] outstanding wines. While the city has a population of about 80,000, (10th largest in the state) [Yakima's] many surrounding rural towns bring the county population to about 230,000. Outside of agriculture, Yakima unjustly struggles with its regional reputation and it’s industrial and professional significance, although the area is home to some amazing entrepreneurial efforts.
	
	Yakima Canyon, between [Ellensburg] and Yakima, holds the proud designation of being the state's only "[Blue Ribbon] Trout Stream." This incredibly scenic stretch of the Yakima River has staged an amazing ecological comeback over the last twenty years with [Chinook] Salmon making a triumphant return to the river several years ago.

Yakuza
	(2004-07-27 +1486/-212)
	A Japanese organized crime syndicate, similar to the Mafia, or [the Triads]. They have some control of the Japanese social system, seeing as they own major things like casinos and the like. They have a strict code of loyalty and honor, which is a tradition long held by the Japanese. Yakuza are usually known to have large tattoos covering their backs, chests, and arms. They are also made famous by pop culture, an example being gangster flicks done by the famous Japanese director, [Takeshi Kitano]. Also, the whole cutting off of a [fingertip] is done by those who have angered the Yakuza as a plea for forgivness. THe name Yakuza translates roughly to 8-9-3, one of the worst hands you can get in Japanese Blackjack, where the goal is 19 instead of 21.
		Example: The Yakuza is a [tough], [powerful] [criminal] organizations.

	(2009-12-04 +1262/-270)
	[Yakuza] (also known as [gokudo]) are members of traditional organized crime syndicates in Japan. The term Yakuza comes from a [Japanese game], Oicho-Kabu (played with hanafuda or kabufuda cards). The worst hand in the game is a set of eight, nine and three. In traditional Japanese forms of counting, these numbers are called Ya, Ku and Sa, thus the origin of the word [yakuza]. The yakuza took this name because the Ya-Ku-Za hand requires the most skill (at judging opponents, etc.) and, obviously, the best luck in order to win. The name was also used because it signified bad fortune, presumably for anyone who went up against the group. Despite uncertainty about the single origin of Yakuza organizations, most modern Yakuza derive from two classifications which emerged in the mid-Edo Period: tekiya, those who primarily peddled illicit, stolen or shoddy goods; bakuto, those who were involved in or participated in gambling. During the formation of the yakuza, they adopted the traditional Japanese hierarchical structure of oyabun-kobun where kobun (lit. [foster child]) owe their allegiance to the [oyabun] (lit. foster parent). In a much later period, the code of [jingi] (justice and duty) was developed where loyalty and respect are a way of life. The alleys and streets of [Shinjuku] are a popular modern Tokyo Yakuza hangout.
		Example: Yubitsume, or the cutting of one's finger, is a form of [penance] or apology. Upon a first offence, the [transgressor] must cut off the tip of his left [little finger] and hand the severed portion to his boss. Sometimes an [underboss] may do this in penance to the [oyabun] if he wants to spare a member of his own gang from further retaliation. Its origin stems from the traditional way of holding a Japanese sword. The bottom three fingers of each hand are used to grip the sword tightly, with the thumb and index fingers slightly loose. The removal of digits starting with the little finger moving up the hand to the index finger progressively [weakens] a person's sword grip. The idea is that a person with a weak sword grip then has to rely more on the group for protection—reducing individual action. In recent years, prosthetic fingertips have been developed to disguise this distinctive appearance. Many Yakuza have full-body tattoos. These tattoos, known as irezumi in Japan, are still often "hand-poked," that is, the ink is inserted beneath the skin using non-electrical, hand-made and hand held tools with needles of sharpened bamboo or steel. The procedure is expensive and painful which can take years to complete.

	(2004-03-20 +73/-587)
	Japanese Mafia that has a strict code of loyalty to one another, following many ancient Japanese traditions such as [the code] of [the Samurai], even though they seem [honorable] they will still fuck someone up, so if you ever meet one just walk away...they love to come in groups

	[Yakuza] literally translates to "Bad, crooked." Lives up to its name. Unlike other underworld mass criminal organization, Yakuza has heavy influence in Japanese politics. One example is during the WW2, when Yakuza members [flourished] throughout asia, stealing, making [brothels], prostitution, drug sales. They were unstoppable.
	
	Even today, they have close ties with politicians, and control most of the entertainment industry and other areas.
	
	Quite a bit of percentage of the Yakuza members prove to be of Korean ethnicity. An explanation would be that Koreans living in Japan aren't recognized as "Japanese" meaning that they are still subjected as aliens. Therefore, socially they become an outcast. It is natural for them to join social-outcast groups such as the Yakuza.
		Example: [Yakuza] unlike other organized criminals have had relatively powerful influence in politics [in Japan], especially during [WW2] when Japan wrongfully committed crimes throughout Asian nations and Dutch.

	(2009-02-17 +27/-8)

Yamball
	(2009-01-07 +69/-13)
	A holiday traditionally celebrated upon the second snowfall of the new year, usually falling sometime in the first two weeks of January.
	
	The [Yamball] holiday is observed by building a "[yamball]" out of a mixture of flour and canned [sweet potatoes] ("yams").  The ideal yamball has a playdough-like consistency and is slightly smaller than a junior basketball (~6 or 7 inches in diameter).
	
	The yamball is then thrown back and forth by the celebrants until everyone is properly tired out, at which point there is a yamball "toss" which is performed much like an egg tossing contest (i.e. subsequent tosses must be from increasingly great distances).
	
	The yamball is then retired to a front porch or other outdoor area.  After a few days, if the Skunk King [Wenceslaus] is pleased with the yamball, He will leave gifts nearby for the children of the household.
	
	Traditionally Yamball was also celebrated by holding a formal ball known as the "Yamball [Gambol]" but this is seldom practiced in modern times.

	Yan is not a verb or noun. It is a state of mind. If one is gifted enough to achieve this state of Yan, the carrier of this mind state begins to experience feelings of happiness and confusion. When these two are combined, the results can be marvelous. Be on the lookout for puppies, [barneys], and illegal immigrants while in the state of Yan. Be cautious however, as overdosing on Yan is possible. In this situation the Yan becomes increasingly sloppy and is a danger to himself and anyone around him. The Yan is then more prone to getting startled. In his confusion the Yan has been known to pee in public and/or somehow end up at some [afterparty] with no clothes on. Do not be [alarmed] however as any amount of Yan will eventually [wear off] with time.

And one day while walking in the halls of Akademi High she bumps into a boy, Taro Yamada. He was the boy that she had always dreamed of. She instantly fell in love as he helped her up. After school she gets a text message from a girl named “[info-Chan].” She says that another girl is trying to win Taros heart, and that she is going to confess her love to Taro under the cherry tree behind the school at 6:00pm on Friday. Ayano is furious and has to kill, befriend/betray, make Taro dislike her etc. After her first rival, come nine more. ( This list comes with the first rival too.) [Osana Najimi], [Amai Odayaka], [Kizana] Sunobu, [Oka Ruto], Asu Rito, [Muja] Kina, Osoro, Shidesu, Hanako Yamada, and [Megami] [Saikou]. Ayano only has 10 weeks to get rid of all the rivals. It gets harder every week for Ayano to eliminate the rivals. If she gets caught being a psycho by Senpai she would get heartbroken (Senpai thinks she’s a freak and doesn’t want like her.

yankee
	(2006-10-15 +2952/-582)
	The word is a derogatory term used to describe Americans by [the Brits], Canadians, Australians and the like; but in the USA used to define an American from the Northern States in the USA, such as New England and the Mid-West. 
	
	It was most notably used to describe to the Federal Solders and other Northerners by the Confederates during the Civil War Era. Even though some foreigner’s refer to all American’s as Yankees, does not make it so. Call a Southerner a [Yankee] and he’ll think you’re either just plain dumb or that you are trying to pick a fight. 
	
	The characteristics often associated with a stereotypical Yankee are [shrewdness], thrift, craftiness, rudeness, arrogance, and [loudness].
	
	
		Example: To foreigners, a Yankee is an American. 
		To Americans, a Yankee is a Northerner. 
		To Easterners, a Yankee is a [New Englander]. 
		To [New Englanders], a Yankee is a [Vermonter]. 
		And in Vermont, a Yankee is somebody who eats pie for breakfast
		

	(2010-12-21 +243/-158)
	a [northerner] that have very thick accents and are often quite stuck-up. They typically think that they are walking geniuses and act like they know EVERYTHING which can be quite irritating. Yankees often think they have the right to travel to southern states and get the 'right' to try to correct southern 'rednecks' on how to speak, or what 'proper' grammar is. Yankees are often very judgemental of the southern 'rednecks' and put many of them down because they have accents or dont use [proper grammar] when really it's just the way that the [southerners] were raised, and assume that all southerners are 'uneducated, incestuous, and racist'. Yankees also have problems admitting when they are wrong and saying sorry, instead they choose to be smartasses about things.
	
	(not all northerners/yankees are like this, but the vast majority of them are)
		Example: yankee: [excuse me] but please use [proper grammar] in MY presence (even though I'm the one that has traveled all the way to YOUR area I still have the right to correct you, cause like, [I'm better than you]) okay?

	(2008-08-02 +268/-236)
	A total douche bag who is from (typically) new york. They are [rude people] and all they give a shit about is money. They could care less about anything important in this world except from themselves and they aren't important at all considering NY is so full of these pricks that if one dies theres always a backup for his sorry ass. 
	
	1. [Yankees] hate the south from birth for no reason at all but they move down here and bother us all with their stuck-up asses and act like they all of a sudden own the place. 
	
	2. You can never have fun with a yankee because they are such uptight [sons of bitches] that anything you try to do with them besides watch a mafia movie or argue with them about stupid shit like how southerners are such rednecks they will always complain about something, even the tiniest thing. 
	
	3. Yankees are known for their repulsive attitudes and characteristics such as bitching about stuff that should not be bitched about.
	
	4. a typical [yank] will try to cause a problem with anybody for no reason at all, especially a [southerner].
	
	5. Yankees are hypocritical people.
		Example: 1. A [yankee] family just moves into a southern Georgia neighborhood, father and mother are lawyers and kids are typical yankee kids, who play video games and watch mafia movies all day spoiled as hell who have never been outdoors. At first site of anybody outdoors they consider them a 'dirty redneck' and they consider anybody who doesn't take a shower 3 times a day a dirty person. They criticize everybody in the neighborhood for not having perfect 50 dollar haircuts and almost despise daily clothing (jeans and a [white shirt]) and consider anybody who doesn't wear a 3 piece suit every day an unemployed or low-class redneck. 
		
		2. Hey man come back out here let me show you [my garden]. [Yankee]: "Man I don't wanna get my new shoes dirty even tho I got 12 other pairs at home and buy more every week for no fucking reason at all". 
		
		A yankee family at the beach. "Yo pop check out this [wata], its all salty and shit I ain't [gettin in] dis fuckin wata, this shit is [freezin]."
		
		3. A bunch of [yankees] had their phone line knocked out because of a [thunderstorm]. In NY where they belong they would go 'oh powers out again' because it always happens in that big cesspool of douchebags they call nyc but in the south they will automatically go crazy and blame it on the stupid redneck engineers and how they don't know how to properly construct phone lines. They will talk as if they could do it themselves but the first thing they do is pick up their cell phones and call the phone company cursing them out in their annoying sqwaking accents saying 'whats wrong with you guys ya dont know how to fix a phoneline? We just moved and and the first thing that happens is the fuckin power goes out what dont you know how to properly place phonlines or somethin ya morons? Huh? Ya [stupid dumbass] how much is it gonna cost me to get this fixed...ridiculous". They act as if they are the only ones in the neighborhood who lost power and they treat the people as if we all conspired to have their phone line or whatever the fuck it is that they are [bellyaching] about to piss them off. 
		
		4. My family was coming out of an iHop one time up in NY when we took a [summer vacation]. Some [yank] opened the door for us and my father said thank you but the guy didn't hear him so he went off on us like a fucking asshole. He started cussing and asking us a million questions at a time like all yankees do when they get angry and  we're just like what the fuck is your problem. He was saying 'what don't ya fuckin know how to say thank you? Huh? Ya fuckin asswipe [I hate people] like you'. Typical asshole yankee. 
		
		5. A yankee will drive down the road and if someone cuts him off he will start yelling and honking his horn, after the 'asshole who cut him off' has gone on they will talk to themselves or their family about it for the rest of the car ride, even if its a 6 hour trip to [VA Beach]. They'll say shit like "what a fucking asshole cant ya see [Im driving] here you asshole? You got a fucking problem with my driving huh? These fucking hicks in the south cant drive for shit". At that same moment they will cut somebody else off and when that car [honks] their horn at [the yanks] they will start screaming at them saying 'what the fuck asshole dont ya know how to drive! Cant ya see Im turning here asswipe!?". Assholes they are the lot of them, and by the way, if you ever see a tag from NY on the road, get the fuck away from him. You will either a: Suffer [from road] rage because of his moronic driving or
		b: Get killed in a car crash because they have no idea how to drive whatsoever. 
		
		
		And if you ever have a yankee move in next to you, don't try to befriend them. They love their privacy because once again they are [unsocial] assholes who work all day and make a bunch of money for no reason at all. I know [a yank] and he told me he thought the reason yankees don't like southerners is because 'they are too personal. Its like they wanna know my fucking family when [we move] in and we want our privacy damn rednecks leave us alone". I told him it was called [being friendly] but I guess he didnt get the concept. Typical stupid yank :)

	I believe the proper name for them are "[Damn Yankees]". [Damn yankees] are a disgrace to america. They are mostly known for thier rude manners and unfriendly ways. They [clame] that the South is a horrible place to live, filled with "Rednecks" (a term which can be found very offensive), and yet, there are thousands of them that move down here! I believe that they should all just move their liberal butts back up to where they came from, and leave us alone.

	To avoid hentai, go for [Shonen-Ai] which is for Yaoi couples and [Shoujo-Ai] which is for Yuri couples.
	
	Example with Naruto:
	
	Yaoi: Naruto and
	Sasuke
	
	Yuri: Sakura and Ino
	
	Yaoi is for girls and Yuri is for boys. :)
		Example: [NaruSasu] is my favorite Yaoi! :)
		
		[SakuIno] is a beautiful [Yuri]! :)
		
		Yaoi and Yuri is awesome!

Yaoi
	(2013-05-07 +1637/-98)
	Many people (mostly fangirls) get the term Yaoi, mixed up with the term [shounen-ai] though the two may be closely related being that they both show relationships between male characters, there is a difference. One depicts [explicit content] So let's clear things up, shall we?
	
	Yaoi is used to describe titles that contain sex scenes and other sexually explicit themes
	
	[Shounen-ai] is used to describe titles that focus more on romance and do not include explicit sexual content
		Example: We'll use the [Gravitation] manga series and doujinshi as an example
		Gravitation would more likely be considered [shounen-ai] due to its focus on the characters' careers rather than their "love life"
		Gravitation Remix and [Megamix] would be considered yaoi because of its emphasis on the characters' sexual relationships.

	EVERYONE [KNOWS it] stands for [Young Academics On Ice]!! [Gawd].
	
	(at least, that's what you tell your parents... muahahaha...)
		Example: Mom & Dad: [What're] you watchin?
		
		You: Yaoi.
		
		Mom & Dad: ...What's that?

	In the Japanese industry, Boy's Love, homosexuality, [gay love].
	
	What every otaku will inevitably [stumble upon] and pass by.
	What every female otaku will inevitably stumble upon and remain.
	Popular in fanfictions usually including the girl's favorite pairing, two characters that are coupled together.
	Consists of [doujinshi] and fanfictions, also drama CDs.
	Male equivalent of yuri, lesbian relationship.
		Example: Guy1: Hey, man, what's up? It's been a while! //[brohug]//
		Guy2: Nothing much, it's [nice to see you]! //hugs back//
		Girl: Oh my gosh, it's real life yaoi! //[nosebleed]//
		Guy1 & Guy2: the fuck...

	(2005-08-17 +4215/-865)
	Yaoi is a Japanese word, which is actually something of an acronym. It comes from "YAma [nashi], [Ochi] nashi, Imi nashi", which means "no climax, no point, no meaning". 
	
	In speech and writing, it's a slang term used to refer to stories that focus on homosexual relationships, usually between men. Yaoi tends to involve graphic sex, often with little or no plot. The female equivalent is yuri.
	
	A related genre is shonen-ai, or "[boys' love]", which tends to involve less sex and more cuddling (and plot).
		Example: I love reading [yaoi] [fanfiction]!
		Did you see that new yaoi [manga]?

	(2008-08-05 +161/-31)
	Yaoi is a shortened version of the term "[Yama] [nashi], [Ochi] nashi, [Imi] nashi"; which means "No plot, no point, no meaning."
	
	And while this is what it DOES mean, the term is loosely used in the United States to mean something else. The actual term itself SHOULD be the same as a [PWP] (or porn without plot), but that's not always the case. If you ever talk to a fangirl/boy, many of them will actually mean it as the following:
	PWP: [Pure sex], nothing else to it.
	Yaoi: Plot involved, but 18+ content.
	[Shonen-ai]: Plot and only PG-13 content.
	
	Other terms that should be known for the understanding of the BL genre (or boy's love) are doujinshi (fanfics basically), [Shota] (pedophilia), and [tanbi] (which isn't used anymore, but it set the ground for BL).
	
	Oh and to those out there that will find this out the long way, just because Juné SAYS it's a yaoi manga, it doesn't always mean that. The rating on the back will determine if it's a yaoi or not.
		Example: person 1: Hey, [the book] says it's a [yaoi], but is it really?
		person 2: [Depends], do they have sex?
		person 1: Yes.
		person 2: Do you SEE them having sex?
		person 1: No.
		Person 2: Then no.

	(2005-05-17 +89/-18)
	[Yaoi] is a term used to describe adult themes and graphic materials centering on romantic relationships between two (or more) males (always [NC-17]+ rated).  Yaoi is actually a Japanese acronym shown below.
	
	[YAma] [nashi] (Without climax)
	[Ochi] nashi (Without conclusion)
	[Imi] nashi (Without content)
	
	Yaoi is basically a [PWP].  Like the components that make up its name, [yaoi] does not have a point, meaning, or end (seemingly), seeing as it is, most often, just graphic sex, and, in no ways limited in explicit descriptions of foreplay.
	
	Some can argue that yaoi is not meaningless.  However, yaoi is often utilized in [shounen-ai] pieces, which concentrate on the plot.  Yaoi, itself, is the detailed description of the sexual process, which can be easily left out of the piece without changing the depth of the story.  Still, it is according to preference whether one would want to read/see a simple lime or a [full-blown] lemon.  Of course, there are people who favor plain shounen-ai.
		Example: This [fanfiction] is [shounen-ai], as Male #1 and Male #2 are attracted to each other. Warning: This story contains [YAOI], as Male #1 and Male #2 will have graphically-described sex with each other.

	(2008-04-20 +325/-80)
	Japanese for Guy x Guy or [Guy on Guy] love a.k.a. male coupling. Yaoi is the coupling of any male of any kind. Including: Anime, Manga, reality, Books, Video Games, Movies, etc. Related to Yuri: [Girl x] Girl/Girl on Girl and [Shonen-ai]: Yaoi but with a little less "action" per say.
		Example: [sasunaru]: Sasuke x Naruto a Yaoi/[Guy on Guy] or Gay [coupling] from the Anime/Manga Naruto
		
		Yaoi Fangirls can be obsessive.

	(2009-07-09 +295/-75)
	Yaoi is a popular term for female-oriented fictional media that focus on homoerotic or [homoromantic] male relationships, usually created by female authors. Originally referring to a specific type of [dōjinshi] parody of mainstream anime and manga works, yaoi came to be used as a generic term for female-oriented manga, anime, dating sims, novels and dōjinshi featuring homosexual male relationships.
	
	Yaoi began in the dōjinshi markets of Japan in the late 1970s/early 1980s as an outgrowth of [shonen-ai]. BL (Boys Love, another term for yaoi) creators and fans are careful to distinguish the genre from “gay manga,” which are created by and for gay men.
	
	The main characters in BL usually conform to the formula of the [seme] who pursues the [uke].
		Example: Yaoi is what [keeps] [fans] [going].

	1. A girl who is obsessed with yaoi to a dangerous amount. 
	
	Be wary about allowing her near two attractive guys, because she may force them to make out.  Some popular pairings are [SasuNaru], Ed/Al, [Yuki]/[Shuichi], and Raito/L.  It may be hard to discern who is a yaoi fangirl and who isn't, and remember: never assume they don't love yaoi just because they are 13 or under.
	
	
		Example: The author of this definition is an insane, rabid [yaoi] fangirl.
		
		All bishounens should fear yaoi [fangirls].
		
		Most yaoi fangirls would enjoy [Gravitation] Remix -is awesome-

	Beware of yaoi fangirl groups. If one happens to enter the vicinity of a yaoi fangirl, and one is a relatively cute looking guy, run. Run very far, and very fast. Do not look back. Do not mention certain shows with disdain around them. One will be clawed, or at the very least, never seen from again. Examples of these shows would be, Weiß [kreuz], [Saiyuki], and [Inu Yasha]. (Don't ask me about the last one, I have no idea why either).
	
	Any [anime fangirl] could be a yaoi fangirl as they do look like any typical anime fangirl. In fact, if she is into anime, and considers herself a fangirl, there is a very good chance she is a yaoi fangirl. So just beware of them all.
	
	If [treaded] around carefully, one will survive an encounter with a yaoi fangirl with relatively few scars...that are physical. Psychologists should be standing by.
		Example: That [yaoi] fangirl scared the living [crap out] of me.

yaoi lemon
	(2007-01-25 +517/-100)
	To understand this term it's good to know what the individual words mean in the context that they are in.
	
	Yaoi is the Japanese word for male homosexuality. Put simply it means "gay". The word is actually an acronym that comes from the Japanese phrase, "[YAma] [nashi], [Ochi] nashi, [Imi] nashi." meaning no climax, no point, no meaning. Yaoi has also come to describe a particular genre of Japanese shows (anime) and comics (manga) that depict male homosexual relationships. These types of shows are becoming increasingly popular among (mostly) female fans of anime and manga. Fans of yaoi often take their favorite male characters, from [any anime] or manga, and pair them together (regardless of sexual orientation in the original story).
	
	The second word, lemon, is a term used amongst the fanifiction community. Quite frankly it means that there will be a graphic [sex scene] in any story designated as a lemon. These types of stories would be ratedp either [NC-17] or X by the [MPAA]. Usually authors will inform the reader of any lemons at the beginning of a story. Lemons refer to any type of sexual activity that includes penetration of some sort. Another term that is used alongside lemon is "lime". This is simply a less graphic description of sexual acts. These stories usually do not go further than [heavy petting]. [Lime's] are also more commonly referred to as "[shonen-ai]" meaning boy's love in Japanese.
	
	So if we combine the two words the meaning is: a story that graphically describes the sexual acts of two male participants whose characters usually come from Japanese anime of manga. Typically these types of stories focus completely on the sex scenes and consist of [little-to-no] actual plot.
	
		Example: A [yaoi] lime: "[Sasuke] grabbed Naruto and desperately pressed his lips against the other boy. He could already feel himself growing excited and began to grind against Naruto." 
		
		A yaoi lemon: "Sasuke quickly shoved his cock into [Naruto's] ass hitting the fox boy's prostate and making him moan."

	(2004-02-18 +60/-101)
	Slang for a sex scene or a romance scene (more often used as slang for a sex scene than just a romance scene) in a [yaoi] fanfiction. Often contains several creative words for cum, penis, and [buttsex]. Usually very disturbing unless you're a [yaoi fan]. But even then it's still kind of disturbing.
		Example: "I can't believe I wrote a [yaoi] lemon."
		"I can't believe [she wrote] a yaoi lemon!"
		"Found any good yaoi lemons lately?"
		"I quit reading that yaoi [fic] once it got to that huge lemon.."

	(2006-05-07 +15/-120)

	2. A guy that wishes to become yaoi, but doesn't know what to do, he is [withdrawn] and somewhat alone.
	3. Someone that demonstrates different than "normal" sexual hugging, kissing, fornication and oral aspects in the relationship.

Remember these wise words. Now [where was I] going with this... Oh yes I mean commitment [yaoi] all day, everyday. Its a part of you, you are one with it. It is your very existence. You are yaoi. Once you go yaoi, you can never go back. [Yaoi] be your life. You love it. You love watching male love to satisfy yourself in your spare time. You enjoy watching yaoi, reading about it, fantasizing, whatever it is you do. Yaoi is the japanese phrase of gay if you must know, so enjoy them yaoi anime fan-fics and whatnot. You are a yaoisexual human walking the earth proudly of what you do and believe in. Ok yeah that sounded a bit religious just now but whatever. [Let it be] a religion. Yay for gay pride. Have an yaoitastical day! ♡

		To my friend:
		
		Continue watching and [shipping people]/characters like there's no tomorrow. I will never forget the moment I was shipped with a rock and all different kinds of things that isn't really physically possible. Though hey why not?

Life is shit, garbage, love, beauty, treasured, art, yaoi, gay, straight, made, anime, movies, tv, gold, short, difficult, simple, complicated, a journey, trash, no wait I already said garbage.

	Term used by [Joell] [Ortiz] before one of his verses, he describes it:
	
	"I got so many meanings of yaowa, it's crazy. First, it's used as a term of endearment [for dudes] around my way. How you say, 'What up?' We say, 'Yaowa!' It came from my man Smash. Shout to Smash. He used to be really drunk [around the way]. It's a distance between the buildings. He used to be saying, 'Yo, what up?' But he'd be so drunk, it sounded like he was saying, 'Yawhuhup?' He'd be twisted. I just turned it into yaowa. Every time I get on a beat, I say, 'Yaowa,' before I [rap on] it. Then I started playing around with it and turned it into meaning: 'you're actually one world away.' I be feeling like my flow is not of Earth. I [zone out], become an alien with it. On another freestyle, I said, 'I'll put you in a hospital because my flow is so sick.' That's 'your ass on wild anesthetics.' I just be spazzin' out with the yaowa.

	A [Yassification] Ceremony is a common ritual amongst the younger generations of this century. Participants choose one lucky person to partake in [the ceremony], and together, they complete the steps to properly [Yassify] the participant.
	
	Step 1: the group must gather in a circle around the chosen one. They all strip the participant of their clothing, and douse them in a flammable oil.
	
	Step 2: a candy cane is handed to the participant who is now naked and covered in oil, and the participant must [whittle] it down to a sharp point using their mouth.
	
	Step 3: [the candy cane] will then be used to carve an X into the participants torso; starting from the rib cage down to the hip bones.
	
	(If the candy cane breaks during this process, another may be supplied, but step 2 must be repeated. If the second one breaks, the ceremony will cease, and the chosen one will be cast out, never to achieve Yassification.)
	
	Step 4: Using the blood from the X carved into their stomach, the participant will rise, and drip the blood oil mixture into a [fire pit].
	
	Step 5: the fire will be lit, and all will rejoice.
	
	After the ceremony is over, participants usually celebrate by dancing around the fire, and eating lots of candy canes. The successful participant in the ceremony is blessed with the gift of Yass, and is guaranteed to become Yassified in the following years.
		Example: “Do you think we should have a Yassification Ceremony tonight?”
		
		“I cannot believe [Racheal] failed her Yassification Ceremony. What dumb bitch can’t suck [a candy] [cane] without breaking it??

Mostly 12-13 years old, these little fucks still think they hold the authority they had in [year 6] when they were the top at elementary school, but must realise that once they enter high school (starts in [year 7] in Aus) they might as well be little retarded kindergartners. 
	
	In recent years there has been a growing trend where year 7's are getting smaller, as in their muscles are extremely puny, their voices are really high and they have the faces of 10 year olds. Their attraction to girls is also fading, as none of them seem to have girlfriends/talk about girls. No one knows why this is happening, but its probably because of lack of meat. Eat [moar] [beef you] little fucks.
		Example: [Year 11] guy: [What the fuck you] arrogant little bitch, know your place in life. [Gb2] kitchen and make me a sammich.

	Year 8 is where you will find all the chavs and roadmen.
	[Year 8's] tend to muck about in lesson, gob off to older years and disrespect teachers. They think they are cool just because they are not the youngest anymore. But in the end, they just get laughed at by older years.
	They also walk round school in massive groups and walk very slowly in the corridors. You're screwed if you encounter a group of [year 8's] in the school corridors, as you can't ask them to move because they will instantly start on you
		Example: Example 1:
		*A bunch of [year 8's] walking down the corridor*

	The guys are widely known to [muck up] in school. Teachers hate year 8s, mainly because of the fact they think they're the boss and [disobey] teachers and write on desks.
	
	If there's any graffiti in the bathrooms, chances are it was done by a [year 8]. Groups of these little shits go into the bathrooms at lunch and write their tags everywhere. Pictures of these tags are sometimes even uploaded to facebook, to show other year 8s.
	
	The girls are obsessed with whatever the latest trend for 14 year old girls is. Currently it's one direction but in the past it has been justin bieber, twilight and high school musical. They worship these things, including pointless facebook statusses telling everyone how much they are in love with them.
	
	Some year 8 girls are sluts. The most laughable ones are the ones who hit on and try to get with senior guys (ie, [year 11] and 12). OCCASIONALY these girls may get senior boyfriends, but they tend to be the guys on the chess team who play [Magic the gathering] in the library. Of course the year 8 girls don't care about any of this, they are happy just to brag to their friends that they have a senior as a boyfriend.
	
	The year 8 girls whose heads aren't [in the clouds] tend to go for year 8 or 9 guys, but their relationships rarely last. A year 8 relationship lasting more than a month is VERY rare.

	“[Yeep]” is a term of endearment spoken by Amish folk from Chili, Wisconsin. Oftentimes, if you strain your ears and quiet your thoughts, you will hear a softly spoken “Yeep” as two buggies pass each other on the gravel road at night. 
	 The word originates from the era of [the great divide] between the ruling regimes of the Amish Nation. [The Stutzman] family, known throughout the community for their prized sheep, stole a secret recipe that had been handed down from mother to daughter since the beginning of Amish time. The [Yoder] family, distraught with the loss of this age old recipe, stormed the gates of [the Stutzman] farm, proclaiming “thou shall deliver [the scroll] of Yoder henceforth to the rightful hand of Edith or we shall strike down upon thee with great vengeance” Ura Gingerich (neighbor of [Stutzman]’s and oldest of the Elders) heard the commotion and exclaimed “Yeep!” then called forth the families and demanded the Stutzman family sheep be placed in the care of the Yoder family. The Yoder’s took off with the sheep under their arms. 
	 The word is a mix of two words, Yoder and shEEP. The recipe formerly known as “Yoder [Vittles]” is now marketed throughout the village as “Stutzman Sticks” The families share an uneasy peace between them, but there have been “incidents” lately hinting at another civil war. Elders “Yeep” at each other to remind themselves of the troubled times the community has suffered in the past. Ida Gingerich was quoted as saying “To Yeep at someone, is to offer them a look into your soul” 
	
	
		Example: [Ida], seeing Mary [Stutzman] in her buggy, softly proclaimed "[Yeep]" as he passed in his. 
		
		Amish parents, when unsure of the whereabouts of their offspring will sometime call out "Yeep!" this is known as a "Yeep Check" and is very effective when looking for stray children.

	A Yeet Cannon in contemporary parlance refers to a pistol or other firearm used in an aggressive manner.
	
	The Spartans used yeet as a battle cry when fighting the Persians at [Thermopylae], as translated from neocontemporary Persian accounts of the battle. It is unknown if the term was in common use in the Greek city-states prior to the battle or if it was coined during that engagement.
	
	The Massachusetts army holding [Bunker Hill] and [Breed's] Hill yeeted at the British regulars and at least one historian asserts that Major General John Stark, King in the North, yeeted in the general direction of General Howe during the British attack on his position. Though cannon were present during that battle, yeeting was only commonly employed by infantrymen of that time, particularly during bayonet charges.
	
	In 1831, Mexican authorities gave a cannon to the settlers of Gonzales to protect themselves from [Comanche] raids. In 1835 Colonel Domingo de Ugartechea, the Mexican commander in Texas, requested the return of the cannon. They responded with a single word, YEET! The famous Yeet Cannon would be emblazoned on what would become known as [the Gonzales] Flag, the forerunner of the eventual Texas State Flag.

	The Yeeter has a long neck, brown feather-like fur, pitch black eyes resembling the vøīd, wing like structure that are actually it’s arms, and naked, [skinny legs]. One of the features that the Yeeter has exclusive to its species is its beak, barely or never found on other mammals. [The beak] is made of keratin, and is actually overgrown teeth.
	
	The Yeeter was first discovered in the state of Texas during [the Texan] Revolution, 1835. Of course, their first reaction was to kill the [critter] and consume it. Finding the critter delicious, the Yeeter was extensively hunted until the kill streak was bought to a screeching halt by 1975 by conservation efforts.
	
	The Yeeter was domesticated, yet illegal wild Yeeter hunting is not unheard of. Pnalties for each Yeeter killed can go from a $3000 fine to 15 years in jail, depending on the state it was killed in.

	A small town in Ohio who residents are so in love with how "tolerant" they are, that they don't realize just how intolerant they are of anyone who doesn't share their worldview. Anything that could potentially be cool about the town is ruined by the residents.
	
	For example, one may think that going on a guided hike in Glen Helen would be a fun time. However, such a hike is infected by the "young men with a cause" who show up for it, and spend the entire hike talking about their cause to each other and bragging about what they have done for their cause.
	
	Also, a potentially cool store like [Dark Star] comics is ruined by the million buttons and bumper stickers that one has to deal with with that contain angry and hateful slogans towards anyone who doesn't share the leftist political views of the typical [yellow springs] resident.
	
	Other examples include the local [head shop] being filled with "You steal you suck" signs and etc etc etc.

	Though the city has been devoid of legal means of income since 1965, yellow springs' economy is sustained purely by the weed, mushroom, and gay prostitution industries. Former location of the headquarters of the Asshole Enthusiast Club until [the club's] leadership decided the town was "[too gay] for them".

YGBSM
	(2009-10-06 +179/-18)
	Motto of the Wild Weasels - You Gotta Be [Shittin Me]
	The expression comes from an elite group of fighter pilots that were formed in the Vietnam war in 1966 to combat increasing losses from Soviet SAM (Surface-to-Air) missles. The mission of the [Wild Weasel] was to to fly ("troll") ahead of incomming F-105 Thunderchief formations. In essence, the mission was to trick the VC (bad guys) into thinking that the WW (Wild Weasel) was an attaching Thud, when they targeted [the Weasels], they would initiate a tactical manuver to hit the SAM site with a radiation seeking missle.
	The term YGBSM comes from one of the original briefings when a weasel pilot stated, in content "You're telling me that I have to fly downtown Hanoi, with one bullet, and I can't shoot at him until he shoots at me..... you gotta be shitting me" --- YGBSM
	
	In memory of the Weasels -- my beloved father Lt. Col Larry W. Biediger (KIA) , his weapons officer, Claude Silva (KIA), and Col. David [Everson] (USAF RET)
		Example: YGBSM-Weasels

	(2007-05-07 +160/-25)
	During the Viet Nam war, US pilots were getting shot down because of [surface to air missile] SAM sites.  In an effort to counter-act the losses, the USAF came up with a tactic called the [hunter-killer team] concept.  This tactic required a pilot, the hunter, to fly low over an area of suspected SAM sites in order for the sites to start shooting.  Once the SAMs  started shooting, pilots in follow-on aircraft, the killers, dropped bombs and fired missiles to disable the SAM site.  When told of the new tactic at a pre-brief, one pilot was reported to respond, "You've gotta be shittin' me!"  The term is associated with [Wild Weasel] pilots who flew F-105s, F-4Gs, and currently F-16s.  
	Currently, the term is used as an exclamation of shock or disbelief.
		Example: "Hey, dude, I heard there was another [hurricane] [headed] towards [NoLo]"

YHVH
	(2007-08-05 +58/-59)
	[Tetragrammaton] -- The formula by which a vicious demonic desert blood-god of the ancient semites identified itself [to Moses]. It must truly have been terrifying to be a people 'Chosen' for special attention by such a monstrous entity, as the [woeful] narrative of the Old Testament makes clear.
	
		Example: The ancient [provenance] of YHVH is either a storm-god or a god of destruction and fire, with a taste [for blood] and [sacrifice].
		

	(2009-06-04 +62/-10)
	Most Hebrew scholars give "[Yahweh]" as being the correct pronunciation of this name.
	
	"[Jehovah]" is a pronunciation that has evolved as a result of time, multiple translations from one language to another, and an ignorance of the Masorites inserting [vowels] for alternate, substitute titles.
		Example: YHWH/YHVH = [Yahweh].
		
		"Yahweh" is not a title, rather it is [the creator's] personal name. It means "[I AM WHO I AM]" and is His name FOREVER (Exodus 3:14-15); it does NOT mean "Lord" ("Baal" = "Lord") and "God" is the exact pronunciation of G-a-D, the false deity spoken of in ISAIAH 65:11 sometimes translated as "that Troop", "Fortune" or "Fate".
		
		Why not simply call the creator by His actual name?

	(2004-01-09 +30/-7)
	Also known as the [Tetragrammaton], this is one of the Hebrew names for God.  The Latinized version is rendered [Jehovah] approximately.
	
	Literally means, "I AM."
	
	It should be noted that God declared Himself [to Moses] using this name, and Jesus also declared Himself to the Jewish officials using this name.
		Example: "And God said [to Moses], 'I AM WHO I AM.' And He said, 'Thus you shall say to the children of Israel, "I AM has sent me to you."' Moreover God said to Moses, 'Thus you shall say to the children of Israel: "The LORD God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has sent me to you. This is My name forever, and this is My memorial to all generations."'"
		 - Exodus 3:14-15
		
		"Jesus said to them, 'Most [assuredly], I say to you, before Abraham was, I AM.'"
		 - John [8:58]

	Jews thought it was blasphemy to say the name of God. Since they never said the name, people no longer know how to pronounce it.
	
	Most people think it was pronounced Yahveh although it has previously been thought to be Jehovah.
	
	When Jews speak about God they just say [HaShem] (the name).
		Example: [YHVH] Is [Great].

YHWH
	(2005-10-20 +430/-110)
	YHWH represents the Hebrew letters "Yud-Heh-Vav-Heh."  It was the name God gave for Himself when [Moshe] inquired of Him.  In most modern translations it is usually written "LORD" (in capital letters) or "[HaShem]" (in the Hebrew Tanach, it means "The Name").  It has been improperly translated "[Jehovah]," based on a German bastardization of YHWH and "[Adonai]."  The word "Jehovah" does not appear in the Hebrew language and is simply incorrect.  YHWH is probably pronounced "Yahweh," and means "I Am That I Am."  The implication is that God is completely self-sufficient.
		Example: [Blessed] are you, YHWH, [our God], King of [the Universe] ...

	(2009-08-05 +91/-37)
	Called the [Tetragrammaton] (four letters), this is the personal name of the Biblical deity. In Hebrew, these four letters are [Yod], He, [Vav] or Waw, and He (most Bibles show the Hebrew alphabet in Psalm 119). Most Hebrew scholars give YaHWeH as the correct pronunciation.
		Example: In the Masoretic Hebrew Text of the Old Testament, YHWH (properly [YaHWeH]) usually has the vowels for [Adonai] ("Lord") inserted, producing YeHoWaH. This codified form was not meant to be pronounced as is, rather it means "think [Yahweh], say Adonai". This was done based on the idea of Rabbinic Judaism that it is better not to say "Yahweh" at all rather than to take a chance on saying it in vain.
		
		Some Christians who were unaware of this, pronounced the codified form as is. YeHoWaH evolved over time into IeHoUaH and finally [JeHoVaH].

	(2004-12-05 +53/-227)
	[Gods] name...simple no? Translated from [hebrew] its [Jehovah].
		Example: me:The only people who bear gods name are [Jehovah's Witnesses].So they are his people as proven in the bible.[QED].

yiddish
	(2003-07-04 +821/-300)
	1.) Totally awesome language that is a combination of german and hebrew. Has contributed words such as: "bagel," "[nudnik]," "[mishmash]" "schmuck" to our everyday vocabulary.
	2) the perfect language to insult people, paticuarly [goyem].
	
		Example: "Oy Vey (woe is me) my [boychick] (darling son)is all ferblungit (mixed up) he acts like such a nebbish (loser)and  [shlemiel] (weakling) he lost all his money to that [gonif] (theif) of a stockbroker. Oh woe is me!

	(2006-10-26 +311/-152)
	A Jewishlanguage based on German once spoken throughout Central and Eastern Europeby AshkenazicJews. The name comes from a combination of the [German words], "[Jud]" (Jew) and "[Deutsch]" (German). Sometimes referred to as a dialect of German, and sometimes denigrated as the "Ebonics of the Austro-Hungarian Empire", Yiddish does have its own unique qualities which differentiate it from standard German. Unfortunately, most Yiddish speakers were killed in the Holocaust, and emigration of the Jews of Central Europe and Eastern Europe resulted in the near-disappearance of the language. Today it can only be heard in isolated pockets in certain big cities worldwide. It is probably the most endangered European language right now. However, Yiddish words have heavily influenced American English,especially that of New York, and to a lesser extent have made it into Cockney. The use of Yiddish words like schmuck, putz, [shyster], etc. by comedians, in particular, has spread Yiddishisms throughout the [Anglosphere]. Even though the Yiddish language is in a severe and probably irreversible state of decline, certain Yiddish words will always be with us, [kein] [ahora]. 
		Example: [Oy vey], nobody speaks [Yiddish] anymore. [Nu]? 

	(2005-10-17 +84/-50)
	A Germanic language invented by Jews in Germany. After being blamed for the black death, the Jews were forced out of Germany, spreading through Eastern Europe and taking their middle-high period German language with them and mixing in a few Hebrew words, such as:
	Ganif (thief) from Hebrew (Ganav)
	[Shikker] (drunk) from Hebrew (Shikur)
	Mishpoyche (family) from Hebrew ([Mishpacha])
	etc.
	The language is written, curiously enough, using the Hebrew alphabet. As it once almost completely resembled German, the language evolved in Germany while the Jews were somewhere else, and therefore the language is still basically middle-high German.
	Yiddish was [the mother tongue] of millions people before the Holocaust
		Example: [Yiddish]: "[Kaynen] di forshtaysen Yiddish?"
		
		English: "can you understand Yiddish?"
		
		German: "Koennen [Sie] Deutsche Sprechen?"

	(2005-08-27 +78/-59)
	ok some people are a little confused, so im gunna try to set the record as strait as i can.

It is also not used by any broad group of people but some people sill do speak it. It is also quite fun for [insalting] people. Also it is not common with [the torah] at all! infact it never shows up in the torah seeing as there were no jews in germany yet so how could the laungegs be commbied? yeah so if im wrong o well but i am allmost positive this is all true info.
	
	please excuse my spelling

	(2004-09-06 +39/-37)

		Example: Classic yiddish words: [shlep], schmuck, klutz, [mensch], bagel, and the wonderful -nik nouns ([beatnik], nogoodnik...)

	(2006-09-22 +60/-69)
	Yiddish is a mixed language derived from German and Hebrew.  "[Nosh]" "[Bubula]" "Keppela" "Tatula" are only a few of the words that are used.  The amazing genetic mix of modern [Jewry] has some people who think the whole world is a  part of "New [Deutchland]" or "New Jihadland"  are wondering why Jews are more successful, better looking than them, and have more personality in their pinkies than most of these people do in their whole nation.  I'll explain:  Modern Jewry is a mixed of Jewish people from Israel back before Jesus (he was jewish though), Jews from the [Rhineland], Russia, Poland, Hungary, and yes the [Ruling class] of the Khazaria Kingdom did convert to Judaism and yes we are guessing that part of the population converted too.  With that in mind, we also had intelligent Russians, Poles, Hungarians, Americans, and other nations marrying into the Jewish Populations and were eventually absorbed into the Jewish Population as well.  Zionists are people who thought that Jewish people should have their own land again and due to actual Jewish Genetics, the land of Eretz [Yisrael] was recreated.  
		Example: Let's go to a Delicatessen to "[Nosh]" on a Bagel with [Lox] and [Cream Cheese] and while we are eating let's say a few other  Yiddish words.

Ying Yang
	(2006-09-16 +270/-115)
	Chinese world view also [rested] heavily on [yinyang] principles. [Yinyang] was a philosophical view in Chinese society of a unity of opposites, each representing the greater and lesser of similar concepts, which one found in the universe. An example would be the yinyang representation of [husband and wife]. Yang are the dominant principles of maleness, the sun, creation, heat, light, Heaven, dominance, and so on. Under [yin] are the submissive principles of femaleness, the moon, completion, cold, darkness, material forms, submission and etc… This unity of one greater principle over a lesser one moves in cyclical path so that no single one is all dominant. These yinyang principles were part of a larger philosophical view of a [cosmos] (our universe) that was “self-contained, self-operating, spontaneously generating and perpetually in motion.” The Chinese viewed everything in this cosmos as a series of interrelating objects and forces that worked and “resonated” with one another, creating harmony and order. This proceeded off of the [Taoist] principles of a natural and unified cosmetic pattern.
		Example: Ying Yang [Examples]:
		Husband-Wife
		Sun-Moon

	For many, it has become second nature to say "ying yang" instead of "yin yang" because of familial or cultural influences, such as family, friends, and teachers. This may stem from simple ignorance, within certain groups, of Taoism (pronounced [Daoism]) and other Eastern traditions.

	Two Black rappers out of Atlanta, Georgia. They usually rap about clubs and girls but they also have some slow songs and a couple songs about life. I personally love them, when your at a party you don't want to here some person talking about genocide, war, and abortion, you want to hear some music that gets the girls to dance, something that brings life to the party and that's exactly what the [Ying Yang Twins] do. They are NOT the [best rappers] but they ARE one of the best rap artists to make fun songs about clubbing, strippers, and just having a good time. If your offended but what they say than chances are you are a snobbish [rich bitch] that can't appreciate anything other than classical jazz, you are a fem-nazi that thinks that it degrades women even though women sign up to be in the videos, the songs, and buy the album. Or your just a hater that spends their time causing "[Online Drama]".

Charles went on to attend Harvard University, and graduated with a Bachelor's in Philosophy. He returned to Harvard for a Law Degree in the year 2000, by which time he was juggling his music with his studies.
	
	The "Ying Yang Twins" are best known for their musical "rap" achievements. Some of their greatest hits include:
	
	1. Salt Shaker
	2. Wait ([The Whisper Song])
	3. FEATURED in "Badd" by [Micheal Jones]

	6. FEATURED in [Ms. New Booty] by Bubba Sparxxxx
	7. Dangerous

	The reason they named themselves "The Ying Yang Twins" is because the Ying Yang is the world reknown symbol of peace and justice. The brothers always have exemplified these qualities since they became boy scouts.
	
	"We love to exemplify peace and justice in our lyrics."
	                      -The Banks Brothers
	Both twins now list their intrests as reading extensively long novels by Ernest [Hemmingway].

	Repeatedly shouting racial slurs and otherwise [offensive language], they are one of the major "Crunk" artists.
	
	However, their background samplings are often quite attractive. Of course, NEITHER of the Ying Yang Twins contribute to the selection of background music, with the combined IQ in the [15-20] range.
	
	In my opinion, I think i could find a pencil that's smarter and more creative, and I am shocked that the [FCC] allows them to rap about what they rap about.
	
	I think they should move on and [think up] new ideas before releasing another album.
	
	I am sorry if you disagree with me, for I am just giving my opinion. If you find the examples offensive, then HHHAAAAHHH!!!!
	
	Ying Yang Twins Are Idiots. Period.
		Example: "[Look at you] Ying [Yang] Twins! You can't even spell your own names!"
		
		Tyrone: Are ['Dem] Franchise Boys' and the 'Ying Yang Twins' related?
		
		Ricky: Probably, they too stupid to even close a window!

	A [provincial], typically residing in the western half of Pennsylvania (USA), who strongly identifies with the nearby city of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, often due to a [fervent], pseudo-religious loyalty toward one or more professional sports teams headquartered there. "Yinzers" are so called because they speak a regional dialect of American English featuring the use of "[yinz]" or "[yunz]" as the second-person plural pronoun. Yinzers are the subject of a number of stereotypes, some of which they are actively proud and consciously reinforce to strengthen their sense of identity, an example being their use of French fries as a condiment.

Known to be very filthy and not familiar with simple hygienic practices such as showering and brushing their teeth.  Their most prized possessions are their terrible towels, which they would permanently trade in [a moment's] notice for running water and soap.

yinz
	(2008-03-14 +343/-47)
	A western-Pennsylvania [bastardization] of the phrase "you ones", which addresses more than one person. Since we "western PA people" do things like slur words together, replace almost all vowel sounds with a "[schwa]" sound (the [upsidedown] e in the dictionary), replace long "a" sounds with long "e" sounds, and refuse to pronounce any "t" that isn't the first letter of a word, this became "you-ens", then "[youns]", "[yunz]", and finally "yinz". Someone must have put this particular pronunciation and spelling in print at some point, since it seems to be the most accepted way to say and write it.
	
	The aforementioned characteristics of our accent are probably at least partly due to the diverse heritage of the population of this area, which is mostly made up of Italian, Irish, Polish, Native American, and African American people, NOT [inbreeding], as someone in an earlier entry stated.
	
	The word has become associated with Pittsburgh in particular, whose natives are commonly referred to as "yinzers".
	
		Example: "Are yinz comin' up [fer] Chrissmiss?"
		
		"[What're] yinz [doin']?"
		
		"I seen yinz at the fleamarket yesterdee."

ynami
	(2022-05-04 +147/-0)
	[Ynami] (pronounced ee-nami), derived from the same Latin root for the word tsunami, connotes a person who is so incredibly sick and pathologically evil that similar to a tsunami, a [ynami] is completely destructive to the lives of others unfortunate enough to be found within their path.
	
	A ynami is an entirely untrustworthy and evil person at their core. However, it is difficult to immediately identify them, stemming from the fact that a ynami appears at first to be very friendly.

	A ynami is similar to a [charlatan], who appears to be [gentlemanly], is intelligent, and is very charismatic. Similarly, a ynami is a [habitual liar] and exceedingly manipulative. However, unlike a charlatan, who's actions are for monetary or professional gain, a ynami is more insidious, acting out of personal ego or simply for the sport of it.
	
	People who do not know the ynami personally are often willing to believe their lies and take them at [face value]. This stems from the fact that a ynami has an uncanny ability to lie and manipulate, coupled with their exceeding intelligence.
	
	At their core, the ynami is a coward. When confronted, they will create lies to try to get out of a difficult situation. They are also incredibly vindictive, and passive-agressive, using threats and [vicarious] means to attack anyone who questions them or confronts them with the truth.
		Example: ''Don't trust him, he's a ynami.''
		
		''Be careful when you go out tonight, he may be charming but he could be also be a ynami.''
		
		''Woe [unto] him who happens to cross the paths of a ynami''
		
		''Stay away from Jose, he's not just [bad news], he's a ynami.''
		
		''My operation went horrible, when I confronted my doctor, he concocted a story full of lies accusing me, saying the reason why I didn't heal was [my fault]. Turns out my doctor was a ynami''.

	(2011-02-14 +49/-18)

The show begins with an African American male with strange tastes in clothes taking several toys out of a box and placing them in various scenes in a large [diorama]. The toys come to life, sing, dance, and go on and on about nothing (like most kids shows). These events are commonly interrupted by kids convulsing (dancing) to a color-changing background, bad and obviously out of work bands and other things common to kids shows such as 30 second life lessons. The show is really a representation of what happens when you give children LSD or other psychedelics. It's surprisingly entertaining for viewers of all ages, but is most popular with children of drug addicts and scene teenagers, because it's "cute" and is secretly about LSD.
	
	One of the most famous (and [creepiest]) songs is a song called "[Party in My Tummy]" performed by a green monster named "[Brobee]". It features him eating various foods that also accompany his lines "There's a [party in my tummy]!" with "SO YUMMY! SO YUMMY!" At one point, he stops eating and some carrots start to cry because they don't get to go to the party in [Brobee's] tummy (they don't get to be eaten). This little problem is shortly resolved by Brobee eating the carrots and continuing his little song.
		Example: Scene Kid: HAVE YOU SEEN THIS SHOW CALLED [YO GABBA GABBA] IT'S SO CUTE!!!
		
		6-year-old: I love that show! I always dance to the people on the TV and I sing and I play and I have lots of fun and the guy is so cool and the other people are so cool too!!!

	Yo-Kai Watch is a Japanese game, anime and manga. It is based on old Japanese legends about Yo-Kai Creatures roaming the Earth. The Yo-Kai Watch is a device that allows humans and Yo-Kai to communicate. The watch can also summon Yo-Kai as you befriend them. The games are for the 3DS and 4th one is coming out in Japan for the Switch (no american announcement). The anime is on [Disney XD] and they have a YouTube channel that it won't let me link so I'll add spaces in between each letter
	h t t p s : / / w w w . y o u t u b e . c o m / c h a n n e l / U C Z W F P p o h e Q [V P] r [c G] 6 8 A 3 a y [V w]
		Example: Yo-Kai Watch is a [excellent] [anime].

	(2019-04-01 +11/-25)
	A Japanese anime series that was once dubbed as "the pokemon killer", produced by Level-5 (the same people that did [Inazuma Eleven] and Professor Layton).

They make him like [the Pikachu] of the series, imo.)
	
	May also relate to the the most inferior thing the US has ever seen, the US dub of the original anime (which ran for 2 great seasons, and the embarrassing third one exclusive to [Disney XD] (US ONLY) with a new production company). This results in mass disappointment, which Japan is making them the laughing stock by having their third game in the 3DS (game is currently japan-only, but coming soon to international release) series by introducing "merican yo-kai".
	
	Also corresponds to the worst toy line by Hasbro (which btw, is still inferior to the japanese [Bandai] merch available), now selling in dollar stores for around $1-4.
		Example: guy 1: [yo-kai watch] is a [ripoff] of pokemon
		guy 2: boi, how can you tell?
		guy 1: take a look for yourself
		guy 2: *after watching a couple of the us dub episodes* wtf is this shit? it almost looks so similar.
		guy 1: told you. I just don't like their voices, [imo]. It sounds so off...

yoga butt
	(2008-02-02 +253/-135)
	The ultimate external sign of a strong and powerful body.  Only after years of practice can a man or woman acheive a yoga butt.  It is perfectly proportioned, very tight, high, and sculpted.

	(2011-06-13 +47/-140)
	OK we get it. You have a [yoga butt]. You can kick most women's asses. You're fit and not fat like most of us. You are a paradigm of evolution, capable of enduring grueling physical work. In primitive days such ability could have meant the difference between life and death in the hunt or in combat. We don't live in primitive times.
	
	[Yoga butt] is indirectly influencing evolution. [Lululemon] is contributing. They want to wear them all day, make it more acceptable in casual and even work environments. They want to show their ass-kicking [rumps]. They can distinguish themselves to men. They get the promotion from the boss who sees commitment to hard work. If they are [self-employed] they may get more customers. So the theory goes.
	
	Its an important issue for women. Consider what is gained and possibly lost when butt-kicking yoga bodies are posted on the the internet. Women must weigh not only health risks, including risks related to childbirth, but also the moral implications of striving for such an aesthetic.
	
	Maybe promoting yoga butt on the internet like this removes a [roadblock] to proper evolution of the species and allows for more transparent signalling. What about women's well-being in general? Is this removing one of the cornerstones of societal cooperation and physical restraint?
		Example: So what if she has a [yoga butt] and wears [lululemon]? Just because she's hott does not mean she's better. [Yoga] is not about competition but enlightenment.

I would also definitely say that [Kerber] Group and Yung Kana are also good musicians that you can follow to teach you more about being a yogurt male.
	
	This leads us to point number 2: Yogurt males are intellectuals who watch Rick and Morty and smoke weed. If you ain’t packin' huge doinks, you’re disgusting! Women are gonna fucking hate you! You gotta watch Rick and Morty, develop your mind to be a little bit more intellectually stimulated. Okay, if you’re not a nihilist, an Atheist, y’know, women are just gonna say “Ew! Ew! You’re fucking disgusting, You’re a little piece of shit, You’re small, you’re a manlet!” I’m clearly six foot seven as you can see, [I’m huge]!

		(About [Yoko Ono])

	(2005-08-05 +2723/-338)
	[Yoko Ono] is considered one of the most important characters in The Beatles history. 
	
	Yoko comes from an affluent and influential Japanese family. It is rumored that [Yoko's] great grandfather had amassed a fortune of a billion dollars by his assassination in 1921. 
	
	Yoko studied at the same school as Emporer [Hirohito's] two sons, where she became heavily interested in the arts. However, she dropped out of Gakushuin University and at the age of 20 she enrolled at [Sarah Lawrence College] - coincidentally the same college that Linda Eastman, future wife of Paul McCartney attended. 
	
	Yoko began touring as an artist, and appealed to the artsy upper echelon of New York and Tokyo. (In 2002, [Ono] wrote that at the time she thought herself avant garde - a real talent, but she now realized that she was a nobody in the scheme of things.) 
	
	Yoko's had her first child, and second marriage, with [Anthony Cox]. They traveled playing music, and shooting short films. One of their more memorable works is of the striking of a single match. Another, was their 1966 film 'Buttocks,' in which they traveled to London to film 365 [Briton's] naked backsides. Notably, a journalist named Hunter Davies was invited down to the shoot, and devoted his column to the story "Oh no, Ono!", which introduced the British Public to the Japanese artist. Notably, Davies went on to write the The Beatles' first authorized biography - spending endless of hours with the band during the Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band recordings. Davies can be seen in the 1967 All You Need Is Love / Baby You're a Rich Man TV performance. 
	
	Yoko Ono met John Lennon, singer/songwriter of the The Beatles at an exhibit of her work at the Indica gallery in London. However, it was not until [the Yellow Submarine] world premiere in 1968 that the world saw them together for the first time. They soon became inseparable, their togetherness even intruding into the The Beatles' recording studios, a place that until then had been a band-member only sanctuary. 
	
	Yoko quarreled with the band, even with producer [George Martin] during editing stages. Nonetheless, the couple stayed strong. Both John Lennon and Ono divorced their spouses. (Interesting note - [John Lennon's] elation in hearing [Ono's] successful divorce was caught on tape during an early run through of [Paul McCartney's] "Oh, Darling!", which can be found on the The Beatles Anthology 3 album.) 
	
	The marriage of John Lennon and Ono was chronicled nicely in John Lennon's #1 single The Ballad of [John and Yoko] / [Old Brown Shoe]  The ballad tells the story of the public's outcry against their beloved John Lennon marrying Ono, and their struggles to find a place to wed. This song was recorded solely by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, John Lennon on lead vocals and guitars, Paul McCartney on backing vocals, guitar, bass, and drums. 
	
	The Beatles disbanded at the end of the decade, and each of the members went their own ways. John Lennon embarked on a sadly short lived solo career, and he did this hand in hand with his Yoko Ono. 
	
	Yoko Ono was ever-present in John Lennon's work, being mentioned in nearly every song on the John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band and Imagine albums. The two continued to make music together (besides a break-up in the mid 70s, but this was hushed up), up until 1980's Grammy winning Album of the Year Double Fantasy. 
	
	John Lennon's story ended that year with his assassination outside his New York apartment. Yoko Ono has been slandered as a [professional widow], and the woman who broke up one of the biggest bands of all time. True or not, she is an icon of the 60s and 70s, and a reminder of a part of music history.
		Example: [Oh], [Yoko]!

	(2003-09-19 +113/-36)
	A city of 200,000 that would be considered a major US city (about the size of Madison WI) if it were not overshadowed by NYC. The same could be said about Newark and [Jersey City] as well. [Bordered] by the Bronx River to the east, the Hudson to the west, the Bronx to the south and the Town of [Greenburgh] to the north.
		Example: 

	(2005-03-23 +194/-70)
	Greatest city [in New York]. [Contrary] to what many believe, it's actually a very livable and [vibrant] city.
		Example: Stay out of the [ghettos] though, there's [nothing to do] [down there].

	(2004-07-01 +163/-63)
	A place predominantly known for its racetrack. Otherwise regarded as the "[6th borough]" of NYC (sometimes Jersey City/Hoboken is the 6th boro however.) For those of you not familiar with it, most of Yonkers is like Staten Island without the landfills; the downtown area is similar to Newark, N.J. Though located in notoriously wealthy Westchester County, Yonkers is largely middle and lower middle class and has little in common with the rest of the county and is probably more like New Jersey (Of course, this would have been an insult before the Sopranos made Jersey hip).
	The two main ethnic areas are [McLean Avenue]/Woodlawn (Irish) and [Dunwoodie] (the Little Italy of Yonkers, where you literally can find people who look like they could be on Tony Soprano's crew). There is also an upper middle class area called Crestwood which doesn't like to identify with Yonkers.
		Example: Population 200,000
		Area Code [914]
		[Zip Code] [107's]

	(2005-10-29 +493/-214)
	Contrary to popular belief, Yonkers is one of the safest cities in the United States if you consider that Yonkers is about 200,000 strong.  People who tout otherwise are disinterested in using logic and/or facts.  To their credit, Southwest Yonkers (home of the lovely Schlobaum and [Mulford] Gardens) is absolutely brutal.
	
	The city is coming around.  With its perfect residence on [the Hudson River] (which is a great landmark nobody cares about), Yonkers is rebuilding the waterfront and looking to return to its roots when the city was [tabbed], "The City of Gracious Living."
		Example: "[Mulford] Gardens is, by all accounts, a notorious [public housing] project: a cracking, leaking behemoth in southwest Yonkers that is teeming with [crack addicts], reeking of urine, infested with mice and devoid of any soothing greenery or recreational space that its name might suggest.  The rest of the city is quite nice."

	(2004-01-23 +127/-64)
	Cool place [to hang] out, the only city in [Westchester county] [NY] that isn't lame.
		Example: Yonkers is where all the cool, interesting working-class people live, the rest of the county is a bunch of [stuck-up] [upper middle class] [whitebread] countryclub goers.

	(2004-01-23 +108/-55)
	A city with a strange [inferiority complex]. People try to say [they live] [somewhere else] even tho there in Yonkers.
		Example: [Sarah Lawrence College] is in "Bronxville".
		[Crestwood] is "[Tuckahoe]"
		The northeastern part is "Scarsdale"
		and the southwestern part is "really close to Riverdale"

	(2005-04-01 +239/-151)
	a city so big the north and south are connected by a major highway. once a beautiful place now turned ghetto, both north and south. [coyle] pl, [intervale] pl, [mclean] ave, and caryle ave are all now hard. some of the north is still at its height, but it wont last very long, schools ARE laying off teachers and the board of ed is missing 600k. As someone once sed, take out staten island and make [yonkers] the 5th bourough of nyc, seeing as how it's about 10 minutes to manhattan (no traffic). Its still hot to hang out there because it is so commercialized.
		Example: My [home]... [look at it] [now].

Yorba Linda High School
	(2010-02-17 +275/-163)
	A newly opened high school in [Yorba Linda] CA. It is completely filled with snobby rich OC kids who think they're the shit. This school's boundaries were purposely created so that all the wealthy whites and FOB Asians could attend. Students of other colors and with less money were turned away despite that it is supposed to be a public school. The teachers are all [unqualified] middle school instructors.
	
	Their mascot, the "[Mustangs]" does not sufficiently cover what these students really are. A decent mascot would have been the "Jackasses." The sports at this school are a complete joke because they let any old nobody with no experience be on their teams. Also, they are trying to claim that they have [varsity] teams even though the school only harbors freshmen and sophomores who are immature idiots. The sophomores behave like freshmen and the freshmen have actually digressed back to 7th grade due to the lack of seniors on campus. The students at [YLHS] have no idea how to act their own age.
	
	All in all, Yorba Linda High School is a sick twisted joke of a school that only messed things up for [Valencia] and other high schools in the area.
		Example: John: "Where do you live?"
		
		Mary: "I live [in the hills] of Bryant Ranch."
		
		John: "I could tell by your bitchy attitude. You go to Yorba Linda High School then?"
		
		Mary: "Of course! I'm on [varsity] volleyball, [waterpolo], and dance even though I've never done any of those sports in my life!"

	Yorba Linda (also referred to as the "Dirty [YL]") is a truly awful [Orange County] suburb where kids think they are rich and powerful because their parents probably have a high level position at a company [no-one cares] about and makes somewhere around $400,000 a year. The average income is so high because no one makes that much but no one makes that little they are utterly upper middle class(nowhere near the "[1 percent]). The school district here was re-drawn specifically to keep minorities out and the majority of the kids you meet here will most likely be blatantly racist but label it being "conservative". The truth is anyone that lives in Yorba Linda wishes they lived in a real Orange County city close to the beach such as Newport and most people will leave the second they can afford to because no one ACTUALLY wants to live in Yorba Linda.

York County
	(2005-12-31 +153/-46)
	York County is in between [Richmond, VA] and Virginia Beach, VA and is also referred to as "The County" or "[YC]" by those who live there. Weekend nights in the county consist of sitting at someone's house thinking of things to do or all meeting in a parking lot (usually [WaWa], Wendy's, or WalMart) and trying to find something to do. If there is ever a party (that consists of more than 5 people sitting on couches), it gets busted by [the YC] cops who have nothing better to do. In the summers pretty much all the young people in YC can be found at the ever most popular [Yorktown] Beach (which is on a river).  There are 4 highschools in York County: [Grafton] ("the rich school"), York ("the most ghetto YC school"),[Tabb] ("the pot head school") and Bruton (which no one knows anything about since it's pretty much in Williamsburg) The weird thing is, everyone's always bitching because they want to "get out of the county," but when they leave, they always wanna come back. 
		Example: What's there to do in York County tonight?
		Hey call John and tell him to meet us up at [Wawa].
		(5 cars sit at Wawa)
		Sooo....what are we gonna do tonight?
		Let's meet Dave at Walmart and then we'll figure it out...

The guys are convinced that they've slept with 70+ girls, when most of the time it's around 7. ish. [The Galleria] is the closest thing we have to a mall, and we get excited when the carnival comes to town. But not as excited as we will be when [Gretchen Wilson] comes to the state fair. Alot of nights are spent on Myspace, but who gives a fuck? We're the shit, and we know it.
		Example: [Yo], [man], York County is f*cking [BEAT].

	(2006-08-13 +31/-26)
	Since York County (the "[YC]") is so "bad" and "boring" why don't we all just pack our bags and move to [Newport News] and live below the poverty line. Let's starve to death. Let's trade in our coronas and budweisers for Colt 45s and Hurricane [Ices].
		Example: "York County sucks, let's go to [Newport News]."

	York University is despised upon by other Toronto universities, such as the University of Toronto and [Ryerson]. It was once ranked #2 on [Maxim's] 'Sexiest Schools in North America' list. A lot of uptight, yet hot, girls attend this fine institution. Home of the rich and posh whose mommy and daddy buy their education. Known for programs such as the Schulich Business School and [Osgoode] Hall Law School (which [I might add] is the largest law school in Canada). It's Political Science program has received accolades and is considered one of the best in the country. Notoriously known for it's left-wing students and professors, and brawls between the Jews and Palestinians. 
	All hail York!
		Example: [U of T] chick: Nice Louis Vuitton purse. You must be a student at York.
		[Yorkie] girl: Indeed, that is correct.

		You're a member of the [NDP]? You must be/or have attended York University before! No one can have such leftist ideals and not be a Yorkie!

	[York University] is a school that is populated with people who do not act their age and who are dumb asses. York is a horrible school and the only reason why people go there is because it is so easy. Here are some guidelines for men if they want to be accepted by the students in that school:
	1. Buy a cell phone
	2. Buy expensive clothes
	3. Look like you are in your 20s
	4. Have to be tall around [5'9] to 6'0 is what they usually want
	5. Be [clean cut]
	If you do not follow these guidelines, numbers 3 and 4 are most important, you will be subjected to childish name calling like fagot, pussy, bitch, fag, little shit or you will be pointed out, here is an example, "Look at that guy" York should not be called a university it should be called a high school. It should be burned down and someone from U.F.T should piss on the ashes.
		Example: [York] where the dumb asses go
		York the school where the [picked on] want to [gun down] everyone

	An ultra-liberal post-secondary institution (though it should be called a high school) located north of Toronto. Below are some important characteristics of this shithole:
	
	1. Large numbers of Jewish professors and students, which explains [York's] strong left-wing views.
	
	2. Close proximity to Jane & Finch, an area of Toronto notoriously known for high crime rates, street gangs, and drug dealers. This explains the countless thefts and sexual assualts that have taken place on campus. Campus security doesn't give a shit.
	
	3. Greedy TAs (08-09 strike)
	
	4. Rich, cocky, and pretentious students who spend more time on their iPhones than their studies.
	
	[York university] is [the dumping ground] of high school dropouts and dumbfucks who can't get into other universities.
		Example: There is a well-known saying regarding [York university]: If you can hold a [fork], you can go to [York].

The admin staff are great at spotting retards and [granting] them admission.
		Example: [Look at that] [silly] [retard], they must be from York University.

	The process by which students are [screwed over] by administrators and student advisers for not fulfilling complicated and [obtuse] university class requirements.
	
	These requirements are often absurd, often being a half-year class that is only offered every other decade and is taught on a different campus altogether, and is sometimes seen as being a cheap final [cash grab] from the school.
	
	The term usually applies to university students who are attempting to finally graduate and join the real world.
		Example: My [adviser] told me I had all my classes but when I applied to [graduate], I totally got Yorked. Looks like it's [back to school] for me.

		Example: [Ray Naker]: Yo York, what are your thoughts on gun control, you have any possible solutions?
		York: What they should do is get everybody is gun and give it all to the police and whenever they want to use it they will ask and they can get it for certain amount time

Yorkshire Terrier
	(2006-05-16 +659/-473)
	A small dog that resembles a toupee with legs.  Its fur looks like something you would pull out a [clogged drain] in a bathtub.  Often owned by overweight single women due to the fact that it doesn't need as much exercise as most other dogs.
	
	Yorkshire Terriers are dumb, difficult to house break, and tend to be territorial despite the limitations of their size.  They often attack strangers and larger animals, disregarding their own size disadvantage.  These behaviors are, however, encouraged by their owners because they see it as being "cute".
	
	These dogs are probably the best example of [artificial selection].  They have weak bone structure which causes them to be unable to survive short falls.  They also are known to suffer from things like seizure, liver shunt, and collapsed [trachea].  
		Example: [Normal Dog] Owner: What the hell is that mop trying to do to my dog?
		Yorkshire Terrier Owner: It's dominating. Isn't it cute?
		Normal Dog Owner: Well it's going to dominate its way into [my dog's] stomach if it isn't careful.
		
		Yorkshire Terrier Owner: Help, my dog broke every [bone in] its body!
		Vet: What the hell happened?
		Yorkshire Terrier Owner: It jumped off my foot stool!

	(2009-07-21 +119/-194)
	Yorkshire [Terriers] are the smallest of the [terriers], but the smartest and most cunning terrier by far according to most accepted dog iq tests. They are also the second smartest toy, after the French bred [Papillon]. While they look like adorable little teddy bears, be warned that these dogs were bred to kill vermin in Yorkshire, England, during the industrial revolution. They are tiny, yet mighty! If you treat them like dogs, they will behave like dogs. Much like their larger terrier cousins, they are tenacious, and will hunt and kill vermin of all sizes (my 5 lb monster likes to kill NYC rats twice her size). They are often seen as [yappy], [frofro] little [lap dogs], but these are usually your poor bred yorkies whose [puppy mill] or back yard breeders were more concerned in making a quick buck than keeping them true to their working class ancestors. They are light sleepers (again, as they were bred as independent hunters), which makes them excellent [watch dogs]. They are dominant, protective, and territorial, often called little Napoleons, they have no idea that they are a small dog. They make excellent companion dogs, and often steal the show at obedience trials, although due to their tiny size, they are not suitable in households with young children. Their silky coats (which should only be described as a "gold dog with a steel saddle" as that's the only color that can currently be registered with the national breed club) require constant grooming, unless you're [lazy like] most Yorkie owners and chop them short. Then they rarely ever shed and have low [dander]. Although no dog is truly hypoallergenic.
	
	They are bright, active, fiesty, athletic, loving and portable [little dogs].
		Example: A Yorkshire Terrier was named the most popular mascot of WW2. [His story] is told in the book "[Yorkie] Doodle [Dandy]"

	(2004-12-25 +363/-351)
	Edit- A yorkshire terrier is a breed of small, obnoxious, ridiculously loud for its size dog that was bred in Yorkshire, England, for hunting rats.  They bred these small irritating dogs because the King did not want the citizens to have dogs large enough to hunt the royal deer.  So the [yorkie] was born, a [little dog] that is unrivaled in being [sickeningly] cute, to the point where you want to cave its little face in with a blunt instrument.
	
	Yorkies have horrible tempers; they will frequently dig their needle-sharp teeth into people for no apparent reason, such as when they sit next to one of these dogs within [six feet] of them on a different couch.  They pick fights with dogs six times their size, which is amusing, especially when a [mastiff] or something rips it to pieces.  Yorkies become loyal to one master, and they hate everyone else and will bite complete strangers.  I've seen it happen, and it happened to me once too.
	
	If you have a yorkie in your house do not try to talk the owner into seeing how much of a little terror the dog is.  Simply [take it outside], tie it up, pull out a shotgun (I would reccommend a 16 gauge or bigger for maximum effect) and blow the little creature all over the pavement, then follow up by burning the remains just to be sure.
		Example: *[Yorkie] owner* "Oh, Mr. Phoenix, my dog is such a cutie.  See, she just gave your foot a [love bite]!  Oh, and another!  Look at the little darling, she's playing 'tug of war' with your foot!  I- oh my, Mr. Phoenix, I'm sorry, we don't allow guns in this home, I OH MY GOD, you put my dog down now, don't you hold it by its neck like that, where are you going with my dog-" **BLAM**
		"OH MY GOD!!!!!"
		"Oh pipe down, you [crusty snatch] faced mother fucker, the world's a better place now."

	(2012-11-30 +88/-98)
	You know those skinny small faggots which are constantly [gobbing off], well there yorkshire [terriers], much like the dog itself just [yaps] on and on and doesn't do fuck all.
		Example: Steve:'Look the little ginger [yorkshire] terrier' [keith]:'yeah I know, [you just know] his dad doesn't love him.'

	(2006-09-25 +339/-468)
	Yorkshire [Terriers] are little angels who brighten up your day.  They are the love of your life and show you undying attention and love.  They are sweet and lovable and make your life unbelievable.  Those who put down these animals and any other animal is pathetic and lacks character and any sense of worthness.  To put down something which cannot defend themselves is not only showing that the person who does it lacks any sense of common respect.  People who do so have no life and can only find some enjoyment in [putting down] something he cannot have.  People who own these dogs are from macho men to older women and one who possesses these dogs show great love for animals and those who have big loving hearts.  So [show respect]!!
		Example: A [Yorkshire Terrier] is the ultimate love of ones life who [possesses] this [animal]

About 90% of the kids living in Yorktown Heights are Wiggers, [Albanians], or Italians, claiming to have moved to Y.H. from various "hoods". The rising of "Goths" is also beginning to take notice in Yorktown Heights. Unfortunately, Yorktown Heights isn't very tolerant of other ethnicities, races, religions, or orientations. Like I stated earlier, society in Yorktown Heights will judge you for every little thing you do, so watch your back. Contrary to popular belief, Yorktown Heights isn't filled to the brim with snobby, rich, greedy assholes. Y.H. is in [Westchester County], yes, but there are poor parts of Yorktown Heights, too, just like any other area in the U.S. There is a high level of police presence and there are many drug related and violence related crimes that are committed in Yorktown Heights.

	This meme is of a sonic character named Knuckles. Basically you are from Uganda and warship the devil. You are: The Ugandan Warriors
	
	If you get lucky and find your queen you must click your tongue to show your [thankfulness]. If you find a poser queen you must make a spitting noise, this due to the fact no one likes attention seekers. You can also jump on fellow players to suck out their blood for the devil. At all times you must [imbue] yourself with a African accent.
	
	Your goal: spread [de wae] to the other users and to find your queen.
	
	Or you can just be annoying as possible and make every [player hate] you.

you don't even know me
	(2008-04-10 +142/-29)
	[The default] response used by someone who is confronted with a truth about themselves that they would [rather not] face.
	
	This phrase is commonly used by addicts, those with low self esteem and just about anyone else whose biggest fear is that someone else will notice their problem and offer to help.
	
	Using this phrase successfully pushes away anyone wanting to help, and the user ironically [ensures] that indeed, nobody will ever know them.
	
	In another ironic twist, if someone you know well says this phrase to you, then it means either:
	
	1) they've been lying to you about who they really are (in which case it's their own fault that you don't know them), or
	
	2) they have suddenly and fundamentally changed in the few seconds prior to telling you that you don't know them (in which case they also don't know themselves).
	
	However, the case is usually that they're unobservant, [self-absorbed], don't like that you were so easily able to identify their issues and [resent] the fact that they are unable to pay attention to anything long enough to 'know' it. They assume that everyone else is like this too, which is why they seem so shocked when [uttering] this phrase.
		Example: "I think you've been ignoring your family and you should spend more time with them."
		"[You don't even know me]!"
		
		"I think your drinking is negatively affecting your performance at work."
		"You don't even know me!"

	Coined in the movie "[The Dark Knight Rises]" by [Harvey Dent], A.k.a. Two-Face.
	
	It is the philisophical summary that, no matter what good you intend to do, as long as you live and continue, you will bring about just as much evil as good, if not more through accident or intent.

		Example: Examples include:
		Falling to the same corrupton you sought to eliminate. ( Anakin Skywalker from Star Wars, Lois Griffin from Family Guy)
		Prolonged exposure to evil, despite good intentions. (Frodo from Lord of the Rings, [Ice King] from Adventure Time)

	(2015-07-15 +36/-2)
	A quote from [Christopher Nolan's] The Dark Knight by the character [Harvey Dent] in reference to Julius Caesar and Batman. Repeated by Batman at the end of the film.
	
	There are several possible meanings:
	
	1. Absolute power eventually corrupts (as in the case of Julius Caesar).
	2. Being consistently heroic is difficult if not impossible, circumstances will eventually push you towards villainy (as in the case of Harvey Dent and Batman).
	3. Public opinion can easily change and will eventually change. Many people have the tendency find faults even when there are none. It can also be easily manipulated. You might adhere to your code despite 1. and 2., you can still be painted as a villain by your enemies (as in the case of what Joker did [to Batman]).
	4. Villainy and Heroism are relative and not absolute. "Good" will change with time. Different people have different concepts of "good" (the actions of Julius Caesar can be judged very differently by different people throughout the different ages). In many situations, the line between the two concepts can be very blurry (following the law versus [vigilantism]).
		Example: You either die a hero, or you live long enough to see yourself become the villain

You forgot Poland
	(2004-10-01 +1852/-755)
	A sad excuse for an [arguement] given by a incumbant President trying desperatly to escape his [dismal] record. 
	
	While a "You forgot Poland" comment seems true, in reality the event never [actually happened] in the first place.
	
	A "You forgot Poland" comment is weak and a sign of desperation because even if it *did* happen as claimed, it would still be a really weak and practically meaningless point.
		Example: Person A: "Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That's not a grand [coalition]. We can [do better]."
		
		Person B: "Well, actually, he forgot [Poland]"
		
		(Person B has failed to realize that Poland was not actually in the group that "went in". Only in August of 2003 did Poland finally send troops, and it really had no effect anyway, merely a token, noncombat force.)

	Reply to someone pointing out a [dinky little] detail that you didn't mention, but which is basically irrelevant, to demonstrate what a completely anal-retentive idiot you consider them to be. From [the George] W. Bush comment to [Senator John Kerry] in the 2004 American election debates.
		Example: You: "Of course, James Bond was played by [Roger Moore], Sean Connery and Pierce Brosnan."
		Anal-Retentive Idiot: "You forgot [George Lazenby]."
		You: "Yeah, well, [you forgot Poland]."

	(2005-07-09 +550/-399)
	First said by George [W Bush] in one of the 2004 Preisidential debates.
	
	Sen. John Kerry said that there were only three countries that participated in the invasion of Iraq - The United States, Britain and Australia.
	
	President Bush correctly pointed out that John Kerry forgot Poland.
	
	The [Polish Special] Forces unit [GROM] participated in the invasion of Iraq.
	
	A larger contingint of Polish soldiers were sent to Iraq in August 2003, but GROM forces were in Iraq from the begining.
		Example: Kerry: Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: [Great Britain], Australia and the United States. That's not a grand [coalition]. We can [do better].
		
		Bush: Well, actually, he forgot Poland. And now there's 30 nations involved, standing side by side with our American troops.

	(2005-07-08 +277/-211)

		Example: Person A: "Secondly, when we went in, there were three countries: Great Britain, Australia and the United States. That's not a grand coalition. We can do better."
		
		Person B: "Well, actually, he forgot Poland"
		
		(Person A has failed to realize that Polish [Grupa] Reagowania Operacyjno Mobilnego (Operational Mobile Response Group) participated in the first land forces strike. The port at Umm Qasr was one of the primary objectives during the initial phase of [Operation Iraqi Freedom]   and was secured by [GROM] . Without it, the delivery of humanitarian aid and supplies in Iraq would be nearly impossible.

	(2005-02-09 +65/-188)
	What you say to someone who repeatedly insists on using [debunked] facts to make [the case] that he actually has any sort of real platform to stand on.
	
	Also useful to say to someone who consistently fails to see [the big picture].
		Example: "Now, I know this has been disproven, but I'm going to go out on a [limb] here and say we've [shouldered] 90% of the costs and casualties of [the Iraq] War..."
		
		"You forgot Poland, you dumbass."

	(2005-07-13 +204/-378)
	A stupid joke started by [Kerry] supporters. 
	During a debate Kerry said that the U.S only has support from Australia an the U.K  in Iraq, and Bush pointed out "[you forgot Poland]". I don't see what is so funny. Poland coomands around 9,500 troops in Iraq (2,400 of which are Polish). Whoever said that poland only contributed "a few non-combat troops" is wrong. Also, I think [the joke is] on Kerry, since how could he not recognize Poland as an ally in Iraq?
		Example: Person A: [You forgot Poland] hahaha!
		Person B: [That's stupid], [Poland] commands 9,500 troops in Iraq you moron.
		Person A:...

	(2004-10-04 +125/-310)
	Started as a joke from the invasion of Iraq. Person A would say: "America went in with Britain and Australia." Person B would then say: "[You forgot Poland]." But Poland only sent a non-combat force in and it was months later. The phrase has become a cliche on [Fark].com beginning [Oct]. 1, 2004
		Example: I have [no example] for this.

	While the phrase has long been used as an interpersonal generalization, it has become known as a racial epithet targeted to blacks only recently.

		Example: Willie Clark, president of the N.A.A.C.P. branch in San Bernadino, [Calif]., said the overall tone of Mr. Perot's remarks and particularly his use of the phrase "[your people]" reflected how culturally out of touch he was with his audience.
		
		"When he said 'you people' or 'your people,' it was like waving a red flag in front of a bull," he said. "It's something white folks have used when they don't want to call you nigger, but they don't want to treat you like an equal."

	(2019-04-19 +31/-3)
	An [idiom], developed in the late 1800's, that nowadays is used in the literal sense: that the person saying this, is telling the person receiving that their mother, is in fact a homosexual, or merely as an insult, that makes no literal sense. But in its [half century] (or so) of use was in the actual sense of an idiom; in that it could be used in a slightly more [nonlinear] sense.
	
	My analysis of the idiom:
	I first like to look at the use of the work "you're" which is the contraction of the words "you are," which I can believe is a way to really emphasize how personal the use of the phrase can be. Then there's the word "mom," [the person who birthed you], the reason that you're currently on this world. Now many people are upset whenever you talk about their mother in a [negative sense], and since this is right before the word "gay," whose definition relates to being attracted to the same sex which is taboo in culture today, and was much more in previous centuries, many believe this to have a negative connotation while in conjunction with the word "mom." But I find it to have been used in a much lighter sense in previous centuries, not being used as an insult, but more a compliment generally meaning "your mother is quite lighthearted," since gay isn't just a way as classifying someone as being attracted to the same sex, but also as an adjective to describe a good experience, or a nice person.
		Example: "Wow, [Dave]. [Your Mom's] really nice. You could say 'you're [mom] gay'."
		"Thanks, John, she'd love to hear that."

	(2019-04-19 +31/-3)
	An [idiom], developed in the late 1800's, that nowadays is used in the literal sense: that the person saying this, is telling the person receiving that their mother, is in fact a homosexual, or merely as an insult, that makes no literal sense. But in its [half century] (or so) of use was in the actual sense of an idiom; in that it could be used in a slightly more [nonlinear] sense.
	
	My analysis of the idiom:
	I first like to look at the use of the work "you're" which is the contraction of the words "you are," which I can believe is a way to really emphasize how personal the use of the phrase can be. Then there's the word "mom," [the person who birthed you], the reason that you're currently on this world. Now many people are upset whenever you talk about their mother in a [negative sense], and since this is right before the word "gay," whose definition relates to being attracted to the same sex which is taboo in culture today, and was much more in previous centuries, many believe this to have a negative connotation while in conjunction with the word "mom." But I find it to have been used in a much lighter sense in previous centuries, not being used as an insult, but more a compliment generally meaning "your mother is quite lighthearted," since gay isn't just a way as classifying someone as being attracted to the same sex, but also as an adjective to describe a good experience, or a nice person.
		Example: "Wow, [Dave]. [Your Mom's] really nice. You could say 'you're [mom] gay'."
		"Thanks, John, she'd love to hear that."

Young Academics On Ice
	(2010-11-15 +199/-14)
	This is what "yaoi" stands for, parents! When your son/daughter mentions the word yaoi, this is what they mean.
	
	YAOI is a [nonprofit] organization where [underprivileged] children with a high IQ learn to [ice skate]. A very beautiful organization, but mainly directed at teens and children.
	
	If your son/daughter mentions YAOI and then begins to laugh, chances are they remembered a specific episode of YAOI which portrayed humor.
	
	(For all non-parents here, you know what yaoi is. This is the definition you'll want to tell your parents - because it's right...)
		Example: Father: What are you reading?

What people need to understand is that NOT ALL BLACK PEOPLE ARE LIKE THIS. This is why us Blacks with good sense are so against Y.[B.E.s] because they are making us look bad as a group of people!
		Example: Tiffany "New York" [Pollard] and [Mike Jones] are examples of Young Black Embarrassments.
		
		Too bad that there are so many of these. I thank God for the African-Americans that are doing positive things, are standing [for what's] right and making our ancestors proud.

	🐬❤️🐬❤️🐬❤️🐬❤️🐬❤️🐬❤️🐬❤️🐬❤️🐬
		Example: “[Hustle hard], ain’t no such thing as luck”
		- Young Dolph ‘Hold up, Holdup’
		
		“Young n*gga blessed I feel like every day god put me through a test”
		- Young Dolph ‘Facts’
		“[Rule Number 1], get the money. [Rule number 2] don’t forget to get the money!”
		- Young Dolph ‘Get paid’

	(2022-07-15 +15/-24)
	A rapper who is pretty much just straight up trash. Representing (or disgracing) Memphis, Dolph commands little to no respect and is just another talentless rapper with no lyrical skills at all and is one of the most boring, uninspired rappers ever with a basic af flow. He's almost as boring as 21 Savage. He talks about the same things in every single damn song, just about how much money he has, how "gangsta" he is, promoting cocaine usage to the youth, and how many bitches he fucks...typical mainstream rap topics. [Yo Gotti] is much better than him, at least Yo Gotti used to actually be a good rapper and have [real life shit] to talk about, and he had a pretty good flow.
	
	And yes, I know that he is dead. Still doesn't change the fact that his music was absolute trash and that he had no skills on the mic, and demonstrated his [lyrical retardation] just about every time he rapped.
		Example: 1. Yo [Pete Rock] was right for saying Young [Dolph] is trash, I totally a greed with him and it needed to be said.
		
		2.
		Dumb person: yo Young Dolph iz da [truf] mane!
		Smart person: Bro, Dolph is trash and about as boring as 21 Savage.
		
		3.
		Dumb person: Oh Young Dolph was such a great rapper [rip rip] rip, he will truly be missed!
		Smart person: yes it's sad that he got killed, but he was not a great rapper. Nobody cared about his music before because it was pure trash. Stop saying a rapper who was complete trash is good just because they are dead.

	(2022-07-15 +13/-27)
	Yet another wack rapper with [no skills]. Representing (or rather disgracing) Memphis, Young [Dolph] commands little to no respect. All of his songs are about the same things, just about how much money he has, [how many bitches] he fucks, how many guns he has and how many drugs he smokes. Some people say that Dolph speaks for the struggle, but all his music really does is promote cocaine use to young teens who don't know any better.
		Example: Guy1: Yo I agreed with [Pete Rock] when he said that Young [Dolph] is trash, somebody needed to say it and I'm glad he did because that nigga is [straight garbage]!
		Guy2: Yeah, Dolph is a joke and he has no skill.

	simply it means when you're in the stage of life that comedian Danny Thomas referred to as "young and foolish". In the hit "[New World] Man" the band Rush details this further with the [verses]:
	
	He's old enough to know what's right but young enough not to choose it
	
	He's wise enough to win the world but fool enough to lose it
	
	He's [a New World] Man...
		Example: I was at the souvenir tent drinking a Coke before [Sevara] hit the stage to open for [Peter Gabriel] that night when I ran into Bryan. He was showing the girls his tattooed legs. His tattoos were symbols of all the rock concerts he'd been to so far.
		
		There was the tongue + lip for the Rolling Stones, a [prism] for Pink Floyd and so forth. One blonde beauty pointed to a hand of playing cards that said "U2" on them, asking how is U2 associated with poker. Bryan simply deadpanned, "I was young, dumb and full of cum".

	When one gets home from school and thinks about doing homework for math class, then goes to look up what does Calculus really mean on the internet, but then he remembers that extremely hot chick in class with [the cheerleader] outfit, that was giving him the I wanna fuck stare, while pulling up her skirt a little to reveal her perfect [gams], and then he gets severely distracted by the [gigundous] amount of porn there is on the nets, and decides instead to spend the rest of the evening shooting a load off. Then after [shooting off] waterfalls of cum, passes out and completely forgets he even had any homework at all.
	
	In other words it means fulfilling your inner animal need to release sperm, or thinking with your dick, instead of using your intellect to figure out things like math, in the thinking fucking part of the brain.
		Example: Math Teacher: "Ok everyone, turn in your homework, oh guess what we have a [surprise test] today!"

		Mary Jane Rottencrotch:"Were you thinking of me when you were spanking?"
		McFly:"Dammit quit being so hot. Why can't I just do my homework instead of [slapping the salami] all the time?"
		Math Teacher: "That's because you are young, dumb and full of cum."

Young Jeezy
	(2006-05-15 +723/-269)
	An Atlanta rapper extremely popular especially within the Atlanta area.

A self-proclaimed "Snowman" who just wanted to try his hand at the rap game. CEO of CTE, and a member of USDA, a better example of [Jeezy's] mark on the game can be seen in the nationwide trade-in of white tees for [angry Snowman] tees. Known for [ad-libs] you can remember and cd's put on repeat throughout clubs all over Georgia and the world, everybody knows themselves some Jeezy lyrics for real. 
	
	Despite what some interpret as biting other rap artists style's such as "Your favorite rapper's favorite rapper" from [Devin the Dude] to "Guess who's [bizzack]" from Jay-Z, Jeezy's respect in the street is one best witnessed in the street. If one cannot understand Jeezy's style, one will most likely never understand the A-town style or, even more likely, any of the South's style.

For example, in one of his songs "[And then what]?" he says "First I'm gonna stack my flow/ Then I'm gonna stack some more." If he's talking about [stacking] money, then at least use the proper words!

These kids might not necessarily be bullies, but they [sure as hell] don't give a fuck how a fat, greasy-haired, socially awkward girl who's never had a boyfriend feels about the work of fiction that is the bible. Unless you've been on your school's [homecoming] court or have friends who have, don't bother stepping into one of their meetings, which do resemble that of a cult.

		[Haley]: Tyler!

	The Young Turks was a once awesome progressive news show on YouTube hosted by [Cenk Uygur] and Ana [Kasparian] with over 3 million subscribers and 3 billion views. Founded by Cenk Uygur in 2002, it was dubbed "the first internet news show" and as a result became very successful. Their success however has been halted, as the show is now past its prime and the ratings are not nearly as good. Unfortunately, for the past few years [TYT] has taken a steady decline. As of late, they have embraced SJW culture and feminism and are ruining what it means to be a progressive, by embracing [regressivism] instead. In addition to that, they have also become [polarizing] and extremely liberal as they slander Trump and the Republican Party at every chance they get. And embarrassingly enough, they have become so careless and slanted in their coverage that other YouTube channels have [debunked] their videos countless times, exposing the logical inaccuracies in each video. Perhaps the only redeemable thing that they have done recently is endorse Bernie Sanders. But other than that, TYT is past its prime and is getting PROGRESSIVEly worse as we speak.

		Mike: On your phone?
		
		Darren: I'm watching [the Young Turks].
		
		Mike: Oh, I haven't watched them since 2014, they've taken a [decline].

_____

your face
	(2012-11-14 +147/-10)
	A one-size-fits-all retort guaranteed to amuse or annoy.
	
	For reasons that [elude] linguists, sociologists, and recipients alike, the phrase is sometimes held by its proponents to be the greatest comeback ever, and one to which no reply is possible.
	
	Several studies have found a relationship between the humor value of "your face", the number of repetitions, and the average age of the audience. A commonly cited example gives the relationship as:
	
	humor = 2^(n * (1 - abs(13 - age)))
	
	This model predicts that for ages 12-14 "your face" [never gets old]. For [age 13] its humor grows geometrically, hence a sequence of "your face" retorts may only end due to [anoxia] or exhaustion.
	
	For everyone else "your face" just isn't funny.
		Example: Bob: dood, [whut] up.
		Alice: [your face is] up.
		Bob: that's lame.
		Alice: your face is lame.
		Bob: don't [make me come] over there.
		Alice: don't make me come over your face.
		Bob: that's whack.
		Alice: your face is whack.

	Yesterday a morning came, a smile upon your face.

	Shining, flying, purple wolfhound, show me where you are,
	Lost in summer, morning, winter, travel very far,
	Lost in [musing] circumstances, that's just where you are.
	
	This song is about the Vietnam war, and about how soldiers crawled out of "dirty holes" (underground bunkers) and "their morals" would "disappear", simply meaning that they would have killed someone for no reason.

		Example: Hey my [channel] got [taken] down!
		YouTube: [Fuck you].

	(2020-10-13 +44/-2)
	Back in 2005-2016, it was a Legendary site/app to use, since people could share videos they've created, upload whatever they pleased, and also, if it was massively successful, could get [monetization] from YouTube VIA Ad money. Nowadays, you can post literally anything that isn't anything bad, and your channel can get [striked], because Susan runs YouTube like the [Chinese Government] runs their Market... Censoring lots and lots.
		Example: Before 2016
		
		Guy: "Man YouTube is THE best thing the Internet can offer, fr"
		Guy 2: "Bro, come on. Everybody and their mother knows that YouTube is like, a mythical place [to chill out] to"
		Guy: "I hope YouTube can stay with humanity, like, forever."
		Guy 2: "Same"
		
		After 2016:
		
		YouTuber: "BRO [WTF MAN], I'M ONLY GETTING A DOLLAR FOR EVERY MILLION VIEWS! WTF!!!!!"
		YouTuber 2: "MAN AT LEAST IT'S NOT AS BAD AS HAVING A MEME VIDEO TAKEN DOWN FOR USING LIKE 2 SECONDS OF COPYRIGHTED MUSIC!"
		YouTuber: "OMG I HATE THIS SO MUCH [BROOO]!!!"
		YouTuber 2: "BRO SAME..."

	Comments are usually written by people who shouldn't have never been given a keyboard.
	
	Opinions
	Don't even think of trying to post your opinion. People will try to argue with you with their simple-minded grammar-poor [idiocy]. 
		Example: On a music video: 
		Rockr1234: I ♥ [thees] band!
		
		DaVeTheGenericUser: I don't like this band too well. They're ok though.
		
		Rockr1234:Fcuk u btich I hpoe u get aids an dye from it!!!1111 u suck [oldman] ccoks and you love to drnik [you're mom's] pusy juwice.

	The world's largest video website, infested by 13 year old girls who are obsessed with [Edward Cullen] and the [Jonas Brothers], random racists and people who have nothing better to do other than post offensive comments to piss people off, and religious fanatics who are convinced that they can convert the aforementioned adolescent fangirls and [morons]. A minority among the Youtube community is the normal honest people who just want to listen to music and see some funny videos without seeing a bunch of morons arguing about Twilight and Christianity.
		Example: I went on Youtube to listen to music. In the middle of the song, I [checked out] the comments and found a bunch of [illiterate] [morons] arguing about nothing in particular.

	Before October 2006, it was a place where intelligent people could place their videos and post music. That was before the makers of YouTube sold out by giving the rights [to Google]. Now, it is a place for [13-year-olds] with camcorders and too much time on their hands, nerds who make Naruto videos playing to their favorite [Linkin Park] song, trolls, and Internet tough guys.
		Example: A reply sent to me on YouTube:
		
		"dude u got anger issues :L , u can take from ur﻿ atitude no one loves u , cant blame them lol , awh is that all u want a hug ? dude ur a big [hypercrite] , , fucking dipshit [lawl] [kthxbai] ,"

YouTube bimbo
	(2009-04-18 +111/-36)
	An uninteresting youtube video typically featuring a hyper-active, annoying, yet physically attractive young woman. YouTube [bimbos] have [inundated] YouTube with asinine videos that typically convey worthless suggestions, assumptions, and information.
	
	YouTube bimbos are usually female around the ages of 15-25. They are characterized as being quite attractive yet overly animated, and vacuous. Thus, the core philosophy of a YouTube bimbo is to emphasize their physical feminine assets and attributes to attract a large audience where video content would not.   
	
	A YouTube bimbo usually creates videos that are given strange titles that initially [pique] one's interest. Their YouTube videos usually pertain to inane subjects or broad [sophomoric] social topics.  
	
	The [videography] of a YouTube bimbo is notably "do it yourself" but some exceptions are made for more widely known YouTube bimbos with a large network of subscribers. In particular, video production involves the use of a webcam or personal video camera. Shots are usually taken [from the head] up. Usually, a YouTube bimbo is scantily clad; wearing a revealing outfit. 
		Example: Widely known YouTube bimbos:
		
		[iJustine]
		
		[LisaNova]
		
		lacigreen
		
		[hotforwords]

_____

youtube censorship
	(2011-08-28 +53/-12)
	After google purchased youtube, google went all out nazi and censored anything that could be censored. Sexuality, violence, even swearing in some cases. They also decided to censor channels for video game developers so people who are 16 or 17 couldn't see trailers for new games that are rate M because they were just a little bit younger than 18. This demonstrates [google's] [faggottry] and complete disregard for the community. If you thought the new [lay out] is bad, this is WAY WORSE!!
		Example: *trailer for [new black] ops [map pack] is out* "Sweet let's see what we've got." *clicks on video* "What!? I'm not old enough? I'm 17 for [fuck sakes]. Fuck youtube censorship."

		U suk u stupid n00b i fuk ur mom every nite
		Arabs are smelly terrorists!
		U hate [BOTDF]? Ur a fat [ugle] cunt [kill urself]!!! *chokes on cocks and dies of gonorhoea*
		The degeneracy is extreme...

	(2008-05-26 +2348/-147)
	There are 4 types of [YouTube comments]:
	
	1. Short, 1 to 3 syllable comments.  These are usually positive, but are still retarded.
	
	2. Advertisements of any kind.  Usually for crappy porn sites, or for other YouTube channels.
	
	3. Negative criticism.  While this isn't usually a bad thing, the highest level of criticism on YouTube consists of insulting someone else's sexuality
	
	4. The insane, rambling argument.  These are most common on religious and political videos, and always against the ideologies espoused in the video.  Often it starts out somewhat sane, but quickly declines into runon sentences about government [mandated] [brain control].
		Example: Types of YouTube comments:
		
		1. i like it.
		
		2. That is awesome check out my vidz:  ht t p : / / ww w. y o [utu] b e.co m/ ineedtodie

	(2015-06-05 +167/-8)
	An unholy cesspool of poor grammar, misogyny, and trolling that has never been seen before. One of the main reasons of the term, "I've [lost faith in humanity]." Don't enter this place unprepared, lest you lose your sanity. Made even worse by the fact that there is a reply AND a comment ratings system, meaning those who actually bring something intelligent to talk about will be be [berated] for their opinion. Never has such a display of [illiteracy] and stupidity been given such a public promotion.
		Example: An example of the YouTube comments section:
		
		IGN:
		Omg Xbox [sucs] so much, ps4 is gooder than xbox, xbox players sucs
		
		NBA:
		[Lebrick James] sucks so much he the worst player ever [floper] crybaby
		
		Any video about religion:
		Omg Jesus is so fake anyone that believe in jesus is dum

	(2019-03-27 +37/-1)
	Where one wrong move will have a bunch of [weirdos] death threatening you. Usually after someone has gone mad from someone else. [There's only one] rule in the comments.
	
	DON'T STATE [YOUR OPINION].
		Example: A: OMG, K-Pop is the best thing ever! 💖💖💖💖💖💖💖
		B: No it sucks and they can't sing
		A: STFU YOU UGLY ASS N*GGA! I BET YOU CAN'T SING EITHER AND YOU'LL ROT IN HELL LIKE YOUR PARENTS WANTED, FAGGOT!
		C: [Calm the fuck down] and drink some holy water JESUS CHRIST!
		A: YOU [CALM THE FUCK DOWN] BASTARD!
		
		Meanwhile, D is [eating popcorn] and laughing hysterically at the YouTube Comments he just witnessed, until eventually realizing what has happened to society.

	(2018-06-04 +51/-2)
	The [YouTube comment section] is a lot like Yahoo! - you scroll down and wonder why a simple video on how to chop an onion without crying has endless discussions on the nature of religion and reality, and the current [government administration].
	
	The problem with many users who [spew out] their unfiltered stupidity on YouTube videos is that they seriously believe they have the answers to everything. These exceptional individuals are very good at finding something to get angry about in the most innocent passing remark and are looking for suckers with whom they can ‘debate’.
		Example: “I got so many angry [youtube comments] last night [just because] I said I liked [cats] even though I think dogs are cute.”

	(2011-04-09 +252/-32)
	[Human nature] laid [bare]. As scary to read as it is to take a [critical] look inside yourself.
		Example: (in person)
		Person A: Hi!
		Person B: [Hello how are you]?
		Person A: Good thank you!
		
		(online, youtube comments and elsewhere, where anonymity almost guarantees no repercussions)
		Person A: [fuk you] faggit go die
		Person B: [ill kill you] stfu bitch
		...

	(2010-01-02 +1367/-225)
	Such a [cesspool] of [illiteracy], misogyny, racism, idiocy, hatred, violence, [barbarism], intolerance and general lack of humanity has not been seen since the middle ages.
		Example: [Youtube comments], approach with caution [lest] you wish to be stripped of all that makes you human. The unreputable proof that there has been no evolution, [god made] us retarded.

	(2018-01-30 +30/-2)
	A greater [reflection] of the average [Global] [IQ]
		Example: Viewer 1: "OMG [Scroll down] to the YouTube Comments".
		Viewer 2: "Nah I still have some hope left for [humanity], don't wanna [lose it]"

	(2017-08-08 +33/-3)
	Bullshit that will make you lose any faith you had left in humanity.
	They can be less atrocious among some genres, however most of [the comments section] and YouTube in general is filled with [cringeworthy] tweens arguing about politics in [broken English].
	
	Not to mention those who are hungry for likes. We shall not speak of them.
	And of course those who reply to month old threads.
		Example: Person one: "[Heh] cool vid man"
		Person two: "they are [nt] a man u [stupid idiot]"
		Person three: "This isn't even in the same thread, at least use the reply button."
		
		YouTube Comments are a terrible byproduct of human existence.

	Where people come to troll, [flame] or just plain [argue] over [irrelevant] issues.
		Example: Basic intelligence is not a major [component] to the YouTube Comments Section. [You're better] off just watching the video without reading all [the stupid] comments (complete with numerous spelling and grammar mistakes).

	(2017-05-24 +40/-1)
	[The section] below the videos on YouTube where people post comments. Also the most [conflicted] part of YouTube, as most of the time people are arguing and virtually flipping each other off. They're also [triggering] each other and teaching the unwary children new words. In a nutshell, it's a random place full of swearing and disregard, only occasionally having a rational comment.
		Example: Example of the YouTube Comment Section...
		YouTube commentor 1: trump is gay
		YouTube commentor 2: no [your gay] u [frikin] retard
		YouTube commentor 1: [your mom is fat] and stupid
		YouTube commentor 3: get of the internet u frikin kids

	(2015-01-28 +97/-5)

		Welcome to the YouTube Comment Section, where hopes and dreams are crushed.

	(2020-12-18 +18/-0)
	where [a friendly] [discussion] turns [to hell]
		Example: Person 1: that puppy is so cute!

		YouTube comments section in a nutshell

	(2018-05-26 +40/-2)
	[Hell] for [9 year olds]!
		Example: A [definition] of the Youtube Comment Section is [cancer].

	(2021-04-14 +18/-1)
	Often filled with Porn [bots], Annoyingly [overused] memes, bad jokes, and arguments usually over the [dumbest] of problems.
		Example: The YouTube comment section is a [dangerous] [place].

	(2017-09-19 +68/-20)
	One of the most god awful hang outs of insufferable [dick heads] and autistic retards on the internet. Stupid ass comments are a common sight and arguments by wannabe intellectuals run rampant. You can't even watch a cute puppy video without finding an ugly racial discussion just a few margins down. No matter how benign your comment may be in a [YouTube Comment Section], [some body] will reply with hate. Half of them can't even spell.
		Example: I was feeling a bit depressed over the fucked up state of [the human condition] lately, so to brighten my spirits, I watched a cute puppy vid. I was feeling happy again but then I made the mistake of scrolling down to that filthy [YouTube Comment Section]. An appalling [slue] of cyber jerk comments immediately assaulted my eyes. My faith in humanity is all but gone.

	(2016-03-16 +28/-10)
	basically a [cancerous], autistic ridden [wasteland] full of fags making "type of nigga", "was about to", and other terrible over-used jokes, followed by replys of "W"s and "L"s. This occurs mostly on Birdmans [youtube videos]
		Example: yo those [fags] having a [real life] youtube comments section [flame war]

_____

Youtube dislike joke
	(2011-03-26 +95/-16)
	A popular trend [going around] on Youtube that is used to [diss] all the people who did not [like the video].
		Example: Youtube video: 10,[475] Likes, 348 Dislikes

	(2017-11-21 +14/-2)
	An app for streaming endless dubious content to one's children on old cell phones no longer needed by their parents. While YouTube originally featured uploaded premium content for young audiences under 10 minutes in length - mostly famous cartoon shorts by Disney Pixar, Warner Bros., [MGM], and other retro classics in their original format - the studios have since grown wise to their content being put out there and [monetized] by YouTubers rather than by themselves. In order to remedy this, YouTubers now have to make sure that premium content now has to be distorted in some way to be permitted on YouTube Kids be it presented in extreme close-up, as a clip with alternate intro/ending, inverted, or relegated to a small corner of the screen with stupid background graphics filling the other 3/4th of the video presentation.
	
	Since familiar premium content has now [by and large] been removed from YouTube and YouTube Kids, it has become a repository of Eastern European CGI [webjunk] masquerading as popular kids cartoons containing psychotic or drug elements to [terrify] toddlers and people recording themselves spending 10 hours opening Pokemon Card packs.
	
	Users intent on obtaining [free premium] content on the web have been compelled to turn to ever-dwindling warez sites instead to get retail DVD images of classic and latest releases thus [circumventing] YouTube Kids altogether.
		Example: No, Billy; I don't want you watching [YouTube Kids]. Last time I heard "Johnny, Johnny, Yes Papa", and "[Wheels on the Bus]" a dozen times with synthesizer soundtracks and graphics that will melt your brain.
		
		Have you heard about the NY Times, [Nov 4], 2017, article about the psycho Paw Patrol  cartoon, “PAW PatrolBabies Pretend to Die Suicide by Annabelle Hypnotized", where some of the characters died crashing into a telephone pole and others walked off the roof after being hypnotized by a demon-possessed doll? You don't want your kids watching that! - Here, if you have a thumb drive, I'l put some Pixar shorts for them instead.
		
		Jimmy, are you watching [YouTube kids] again? Give me the old phone so I can password-lock it! What the heck is this? Donald Duck and Mickey Mouse doing LSD? Turn it off!

	During the ancient times of 2008, many youtubers needed background tracks or had to be audio-swapped. One of the most common songs ever used was [Dreamscape], on [009 sound system].
	
	Many videos can be seen with this music being used. It's on par with 'Blow me away' by Breaking Benjamin , 'Bring me to Life' by Evanescence and 'Through the fire and flames' by dragonforce.

	Racist who run to any video with black people or with white people dancing like black people to leave a whole bunch of racist, ignorant comments. Most of the racist however wouldn't have the nerve to say half the things to a black person/minority face to face so they have to be hard core [Nazi's] on [You Tube] because that's the only place they might actually be believable.
	
	In real life the You Tube Nazi are failures and they blame the fact that they have a bullshit job at Wal-Mart on blacks and other minorities...even though other white people some how manage to go to college and get decent jobs.

youtube poop
	(2007-11-04 +2374/-348)
	YouTube Poop is a name used for videos posted on YouTube which are usually nonsensical and random. They are simply just randomly chosen clips from things such as cartoons, clipped, looped and remixed to make it sound really strange. The most commonly used clips include scenes from the [CD-i] game of The Legend of Zelda, and a Mario game called [Hotel Mario]. These particular YouTube Poop videos (or YTP) are popular among the internet-savvy people and are a major source of internet culture. Some of YTP is inspired by media shown on YTMND.com, such as the public service message given by Sonic the Hedgehog about being touched in uncomfortable places. The most popular source of clips would be from the Super Mario Bros. cartoon, episode called "[Mama Luigi]". The most used phrase from this episode would be "That's [MAMA Luigi] to you, Mario!" 
		Example: Phrases from YouTube Poops' most popular clips: 
		
		"[MAMA LUIGI]?! *laughs*" - Mario
		"That's [MAMA Luigi] to you, Mario!" - Luigi, Super Mario Bros.
		
		"Gee, it sure is boring around here!" - Link, The Legend of Zelda [CD-i]
		
		"My booooy." - Old man, The Legend of Zelda CD-i
		(Usually pronounced "Mah boiiii.") 
		
		"Or else you will DIE!" - Ganon, The Legend of Zelda CD-i
		
		"And YOU gotta help us!" - Luigi, Hotel Mario
		
		"Kids, there's nothing more cool than being hugged by someone ya like. But if someone tries to touch you in a place or in a way that makes you feel uncomfortable, that's NO good. It's your body; No one has the right to touch you if you don't want them to. So, what do ya do? First, ya say NO! Then, ya get outta there!" - Sonic, The Adventures of Sonic the Hedgehog

		Character 3: SHUSH THE [FAF] UPP.
		Character 2: Holy [shish].

	(2008-04-16 +357/-262)
	Cartoons randomly remixed together would be the most simple definition. Some of them are well made, have make some kind of sense and some kind of clever joke, but that's the 1% of youtube poops. The remaining 99% is a monument to the amount of stupid people all over youtube: They consist of taking an already popular clip from a cartoon, picking one of [the frames] and [lagging it] for a while so it will sound like stuttering, repeating the clip several times applying the same old video effects from [wmm] we have all seen so many times already and mixing up the words and sentences with other cartoon clips to make it sound like they are saying something silly like "Your ass drives me crazy"
	For some reason, it usually results in most people with a [retarded sense of humor] loving them and making them more popular, eventually gaining enough fans to brainwash people who didn't have that sense of humor in the first place to make them think it's actually funny.
		Example: Random youtube poop fan: ROFLMAO!!11! hes sayin I wan some [mama luigi] in slow motion now! lol! nao its sayin in [hig] speed! its sound so funy! zomg teh colors are all liek [changin] now!

		Example: youtube [poopable] stuff:
		mario cartoon: that's [MAMA luigi] to u mario! (wheeze)
		hotel mario: i hope she made [LOTSA SPAGHETTI]!!!!!!!!!!
		link: great ill get my stuff! squadelah! were off!

	A YouTube Poop, or [YTP], is a mix of media (most commonly video) to generate a video that either stuns, annoys, or entertains its audience.  Contrary to popular belief, YTP is not limited to Zelda and Mario cartoons, Over 9000, or Sonic cartoons, but it can be a mix of anything; material is unlimited.
	
	The definition of YouTube Poop and the style is always being altered, and viewers of it have different reactions.  To some, YTP is an art, and to others, it is worthless and pointless, with no reason to exist.
	
	The first YouTube Poop, "I'D SAY HE'S HOT ON OUR TAIL" by SuperYoshi, was created in 2004, using [Super Mario Bros. 3], and since then, YTP has evolved into a community of more than 200 [poopers].

		[JingWu]
		KingNecroPope

	(2013-06-11 +41/-7)
	Funny and creative edits on YouTube. Most people think the source is limited to [CDI] cutscenes, but often people use things like SpongeBob SquarePants, movies and adult shows. I've attempted at making some [YouTube Poops], and it takes a lot of work. They are widely hated because of the bad ones that seem to be the most popular. Good YTPs often include changing sentences in creative ways to create a story or joke, making pinpoint edits and repeating them, changing pitch frequencies and speed to create funny and unexpected sounds and having characters like SpongeBob [rob banks] or shoot people. Bad YTPs are often too morbid or use dinner, wegee or other meme replacements
		Example: "We're stuck in here with that, that, w@#%!@
		[Spongebob] with gun in bank: " [you people] are driving me crazy!" Patrick with money: "let's go!"
		[Youtube poop]

	Youtube poops has now become enjoyable to people who like random funny entertainment. In fact it is so popular now, people have made websites which may include poops of some of the most famous "[poopers]."
	
	Amateur poopers may make random clips that are slow a lot of the time, bizarre effects, or too much repetition. They usually state that this is their first poop to notify people to go easier on the comments.
	
	Most poops are made with Windows Movie Maker because it's free and does what is necessary for any poop. Better poopers may use movie programs you would have to pay for, even a good quality program such as Sony Vegas to include powerful effects like putting an image in or VIV (video in video).
	
	Popular catchphrases in Youtube poops are beginning to grow. The most popular ones would be: "[Mama Luigi]", "[You must die]", "Spaghetti", "TOAST!", "Mah boi", "Pingas", "Dinner", and many less popular ones like: "(I'll grab my) stuff!", "It burns!", "Illegal you know." and "Check out [the enclosed instruction book]." Though many other phrases are learned by watching lots of Youtube poops.

	Hateful, racist, sexist, immature, misspelled, questionable, comments made by [internet trolls] mainly consisting of an [age group] of 7-13, written on a site known as youtube.

		jesse99: FAKE AND GAY!!

	(2011-05-28 +100/-24)
	The disgusting creatures known as youtube trolls are losers who have nothing better to do than sit on their computers all day and start arguments on youtube. Beware the trolls, as some may unite against certain groups or videos on youtube and their supporters. For example, they may [gang up] and vote each other's comments up and flag every other comment as spam. They'll then feed off of [the madness] of the arguments they start. The best way to combat youtube trolls is to ignore them and block them. If they're making several accounts to troll you like the no life douchebags that they are, set your account privacy so only friends can send you messages and comment on your channel. Feel free to report them also.
	
	[Protip]: make sure your youtube name isn't easy to copy by capitalizing an i or having a lowercase l. Some trolls will jump on the opportunity to [impersonate] you by creating a new account with a name identical to yours. I've suffered this way. Report the channel impersonating you, and if they were enough of a [douchefag] they'll most likely be banned within a few days.
		Example: Filipinos4islanders: lol ur a fanboy dickrider. UMADBRO?
		
		TheSpanishFilipino: FAGGOT!
		
		TheMexicanInvasion: yeah u fag dickrider y u mad
		
		KoreansDoItBest: [LOL FAGGOT] NO ONE LIEKS U
		
		*[all thumbs] up each others comments and flag victim as spam*
		
		note: these are real [youtube troll] messages I've gotten on a video. Never respond to youtube trolls. It leads to more pain and agony as they suck all the life out of your soul.

	(2011-06-08 +47/-10)
	someone who trolls [youtube comments], usually by saying something controversial or that will piss people off. these can be found at [the comments section] on a youtube video.(duh). most commonly trolled videos are Metal music videos,obama speeches. ones that trolls metal videos often have a screen name like "justinbeibergirl" or "disneyrox12".people who rely on the anomimity of the internet. people who [no one gives a shit] about so they piss people off over the computer.

	(2012-05-15 +31/-12)
	Definition - self centered, egotistical leeches that thirst for rage.
	
	Characteristics:
	-Mostly child-like in nature (ex. poor grammar, spelling and narrow-minded posts), Trolls may be as they seem, or simply using this childish disguise to provoke more rage.
	-Comments are blatantly obvious for the most part, usually sporting a phrase completely opposite of what you'd expect
	-Usernames reflecting common annoyances in today's [internet culture] (ex. "troll3r", "Umadbr0", "l0lf4gz", "itr0llu")
	-Not all trolls exist to start an internet riot, a lot of them wait to tear down another users post in hopes of encouraging rage. (ex. "Nice spelling Noob, you obviously are retarded")
	
	Trolls can be good or bad.
	
	[Good Troll] - "[Megadeth] Sucks!!" on a Megadeth music video comment section. Obviously a light hearted attempt to [enrage] people who can't take an obvious joke,
	
	Bad Troll - "Megadeth is overrated, [Mustaine] is a coward, a poor guitar player and an egotistical pussy. They have yet to gain any fanbase or sell any decent records in decades...sellouts." This is obviously a Troll Comment whose entire purpose is to spark a rage war among every viewer of said video.

YouTube.com
	(2012-04-26 +180/-13)
	What was once a beautiful video sharing website made by three former [PayPal] guys, it's now one owned by Google and it has changed for the absolute worse.
	
	Thanks [to Google], YouTube channels look very tacky.
	Channel [layouts] are too big and users can't see their custom backgrounds well. There’s no changing it.
	
	If you want a YouTube account, you are forced to get [a Google] account and merge it... which is why I didn't sign up.
	
	More importantly, Google took away [freedom of speech] from YouTube. We can't upload videos of various content without them and these corporations breathing down our necks. Many awesome accounts and videos got pulled because of them. They should have their accounts and videos back.
	
	That’s why we need the 3 dudes back. To get everything back to normal and put the “You” back in YouTube.
	
	Any users reading this can put this in their video to help bring the good times back because I don't want YouTube to keep failing like this.
		Example: Because of Google owning YouTube.com and changing it, MANY accounts have be taken off and many users like Epic0rpheus left the site. Who can blame them?
		
		Like guciobrian posted-
		
		[Remember when]﻿ you﻿ could watch a video without having to﻿ sit through commercials?
		
		Remember when music videos were uploaded by﻿ users and﻿ not [VEVO]
		
		Remember when all the﻿﻿ info was to the﻿ right of﻿ the video?
		
		Remember you﻿ could rate a video [1-5] stars?
		
		Remember the﻿ famous yellow subscribe button?
		
		Remember when the users controlled the site and not corporations?
		
		Yes I remember.

	Do you want to express your opinion? Get ready to be hated and get your channel taken down for no reason?
	Do you want to do anything creative? Go fuck yourself - YouTube
	
	If you want to be successful, do something [easy like] becoming a let's player or a [vlogger]. Oh yeah, and make sure you have a pretty face so idiots can fantasize on being in bed with you.
	Or you could become the utter scum of YouTube and become a [reactionist]. What's a reactionist? They're basically people who watch a video and do nothing but yell, "oh shit" or "dayum!" without being creative. In fact, they steal the video!
	
	So there you have it. A site that can be amazing but chooses to be shit.

	The platform also has an issue of copyright-striking or blocking videos even if it falls under [fair use].
	The Youtube support is honestly average and is the last resort if you get your account suspended for no reason.

	YOYO is not merely a term. It's a way of thinking. It's a state of mind. The basic principle of YOYO states that the journey, not the destination, is what permeates us with happiness. Thus, the start of the journey, the beginning of our life is of vital importance. The end could be anything. The end could be a slow, painful, [lung cancer]... or a sudden [plane crash]. Ergo, the most rational course of action is to give more importance to our youth and not the end.

Yu Yu Hakusho
	(2010-08-16 +340/-41)
	One day, 14 year old [Yusuke Urameshi] suddenly finds himself dead, having died pushing a child out of the way of oncoming traffic. Since he has such a bad personality, even the Spirit World was caught by [surpise] that he would sacrifice himself. [Yusuke] soon finds out he wasn't supposed to die and has a chance for resurrection and bringing his body back to life. After being resurrected, Yusuke becomes a Spirit Detective, along with his comrades, and one adventure after another happens, whether it be an investigation or a fighting tournament.
		Example: Yu Yu Hakusho aired on [Toonami] in 2003 and was also shown on [Adult Swim] from 2002–2006. There are a total of [112] episodes.

	(2007-12-14 +97/-17)
	A great show that once brought enlightenment and renaissance to Cartoon Network before the assgiblets who lead the network decided to take it off and replace with shitty shows like [Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends], reruns of Grim and Evil (which used to be alright until they got rid of Evil [Con Carne] and made it into Billy and Mandy) and Naruto...
	
	Unlike Naruto, YYH's characters are completely unique from each other, each with his/her own back story and shortcomings. The anime even has a cool introduction where [Yusuke] starts off as this average Joe trouble-student who's life is changed after his life was taken away trying to a kid from a bunch of negligent drivers.
		Example: I'm [getting tired] of all [the Billy] and Mandy whoring on [Cartoon Network], when are they going to show Yu Yu Hakusho...oh wait, they took it off because little wuss children wanted Naaaaruto.....

	A kick-ass anime where a group of teenagers confront demons and dwindle on the border between life and death, demons and humans, and reality and fantasy. It is one of VERY few anime where the main character isn't all about virtue and peace and all that other stuff that makes animes look like comic book heroes. Man I hate it when they do that. The series goes on for 104 episodes with 7 sagas, the last three of which are the longest. 
	
	The series opens with Yuske Urameshi, a 14 year old loner who has no friends, never attends school, and gets into fights just to [blow off steam]. In a freak accident, he gets run over by a car and dies. He is confronted by the "grim reaper"(really a young lady in a kimono who rides on an oar) who says his death was [not supposed to happen], so he gets another chance at lif, but becomes a detective for the underworld. His main weapon is a weapon of concentrated aura blown from his finger as a gun.
	
	He is soon joined by [Kuwabara], a fellow classmate who's only goal is to beat Yusuke in a street fight, but never does, [Kurama], a collected individual who is "[bishonen]", and is constantly pushing himself to his own suicide. Basically, Kurama is a masochist. And [Hiei], a demon convicted who weilds a sword and constantly wants to taste the blood of his opposers. He never truly sheds his "evil" skin.
	
	Basiclly, after Trigun and Fullmetal Alchemist, Yu yu Hakusho is the best anime ever made.

yugioh
	(2006-05-01 +575/-145)
	  Yu-gi-oh is a television/manga series created by [Kazuki] Takahashi which is also a popular card game. The original manga was published in Shonen Jump Magazine. The title Yu-gi-oh is a play on words in japanese. "Yugi oh" translated means "king of games" which is the alternate title in the english version. An alternate spelling in Japanese, Yujyo (taken from the first kanji of the main character Yugi Motou and one of his friends [Joey Wheeler], [Katsuya] Jounouchi in the japanese version, alternate spelling Jyonouchi) means "friendship" which is a reoccuring theme in the series.
	  In the dubbing process alot has been cut out and changed to suit a younger audience (and make more money of the merchandising). The dubbed version of Yu-gi-oh is not a true representation of the story and it is better to watch the subtitled Japanese versions that are [floating about] out there or even read the manga.

Yugoslavia
	(2012-01-22 +271/-47)
	This is the biggest bullshit ever. We had it all. One powerful country that went down to the fucking toilet.
	
	I am from Croatia and I can live aside my fellow Serbian like brothers; but you people are too uptight about your "[national pride]" to do so. You ruin a good country. Fuck racism. [Fuck you all]. Fuck fascism. Fuck [nationalism].
		Example: Yugoslavia was a good [vision] of a [country] that should never have [broken] up.

	(2005-03-15 +435/-108)
	The country of Yugoslavia was, at one time, the largest state in south-eastern Europe, the region known as the Balkans. The country was home to many peoples including Slovenes, [Croats], [Serbs], Montenegrins, Albanians, and [Macedonians]. Yugoslavia was also home to different religions such as Roman Catholic, Christian Orthodox and Islam.     
	        The kingdom of Yugoslavia, which was first know as The Kingdom of Serbs, Slovenes and Croats, was formed after [World War 1] when the Austro-Hungarian empire signed the [Treaty of Versailles]. The treaty broke apart the empire and provinces of [Slovenia], [Croatia] and [Bosnia] wanted to create their own independent kingdom. Yugoslavia (name changed in 1929, meaning “land of the south Slavs”) was created with the king of Serbia, Alexander I at head. Many non-Serbs felt they had little say in the running of the kingdom and the king ruled as a dictator until being assassinate in [1934]. 
	     In 1941, Yugoslavia fell to Germany and was divided among Germany, Italy and Hungary. Yugoslavia emerged from World War 2 as an independent communist federation of [Yugoslav] republic lead by [Josip] (Tito) [Broz]. World War II had left scars of ethnic identities. Following [Tito’s] death in 1980, nationalism became a powerful tool for politicians to use to win over their respective peoples. The growing interest in [Serb] nationalism helped a Serb nationalist, [Slobodan Milosevic] rise to power. Milosevic intended to make the Serbs dominant in Yugoslavia and create a “Greater Serbia”. In 1990, communism collapsed entirely following the elections held in the republics of Yugoslavia and nationalism was the most powerful force in country’s politics. 
	      In 1991, Slovenia and Croatia declared independence followed by [Macedonia] later in the year and Bosnia-Herzegovina in early 1992. Milosevic argued that their declarations of independence were illegal and at the Serbs’ instructions, the Yugoslav army was sent into Slovenia in, June 1991, to try and stop the republic from declaring independence but quickly withdrew. Milosevic was willing to let Slovenia go, but now he had set his eyes on Croatia and sent his army into Croatia. In 1992, Croatia agreed to a [cease-fire] leaving 30 percent of Croatia occupied by the Serbian Yugoslav army. In 1992, the European Community (EC) recognized Slovenia and Croatia as independent countries. In 1992, the Yugoslav army went into Bosnia- Herzegovina to “cleanse” the republic of Muslims and other non-Serbs. The fighting would continue in Croatia and Bosnia until a cease-fire is arranged in 1994 in Bosnia and Croatia but the cease-fire would end in 1995. The final cease-fire would be called on October in 1995 in both Croatia and Bosnia, ending years of slaughter and “[ethnic cleansing]” the likes of which had not been seen since the Jewish killings during World War II.
	     The country of Yugoslavia, which at one time had a population of 45 million, was now divided into 5 different countries: Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Serbia, and Macedonia Almost overnight, the world’s perception of Yugoslavia went from being a peaceful, serene and stable country, into a land of murder and refugees and the world was left wondering, what went wrong.
		Example: Yugoslavia was once a [peaceful] country, then when [Tito] died, it all went [to shit].

	(2005-08-29 +185/-65)
	Yugoslavia was not a [nation-state] but a state of many nationalities. It was once a nice [big country], until pitiful [country's] within Yugoslavia broke away which is why everything has gone to shit.
		Example: Just think about it for a moment. Yugoslavia would have been much [better off] as one [big state]. there never would have been any wars, [hundreds and thousands] of people would not have died and the region would be much more stable today.

	(2008-06-14 +77/-37)
	a nation that had people of many ethnic groups, languages, religions, alphabets and other catagories live together under one flag and one ruler. It was formed after World War I as a kingdom. The name "Yugoslavia" technically means the "Land of the South Slavs". It was later ruled in a dictatorial manner and during World War II the country was torn apart partially due to actions by the Axis powers. One example of this calamity is that the Utashe, a Croatian fascist group established a Croatian [puppet state] and waged a campaign of extermination against the Serb ethnic group. A Croatian Communist, Josef "Tito" [Broz], managed to reunite Yugoslavia at [the war's end] and he ruled the entire land under his version of Communism (independent of the influence of the Soviet leaders) until his death in 1980. The communist glue lost its hold on the country by the end of the decade, opening the way for fascists like [Slobodan Milosevic] and nationalists like [Franjo Tudjman] and others to stir up ethnic tensions. The Communist government resigned and voted itself out of existance in early 1990 and elections were soon held. Milosevic the son-of-a-bitch wanted control of the land for himself and his policies led to several years of [secession], wars and "ethnic cleansing" and a new Holocaust. The nation fell apart in a raging cauldron of violence and now Yugoslavia is no more. There are now several ethnically-based countries, although Bosnia is a [mixed bag] republic consisting of people in the Croat, Serb and Muslim ethnic groups. "Yugoslavia" is now a word that refers to a country torn apart by hatred and violence between ethnic groups. 
		Example: 1. [Rwanda] and the [Sudan] ([Darfur] region) have experienced ethnic genocide just like Yugoslavia.
		
		2. Some ignorant bigots with their attitudes concerning a certain black Presidential candidate and racist mythology about immigrants (legal and not) and post-9/11 fears stemming from terrorist actions are talking of "America for the Americans" and "[RAHOWA]". They use these issues to justify their hate. They want to turn this great nation into another Yugoslavia. That way is NOT the answer.

Yuma Yummies
	(2007-10-19 +388/-71)
	The origins of the [Yuma Yummy]:
	
	In 1978, the [USMC] identified a need to train its aviators [in the six] major functions of Marine aviation. Thus, in 1985, the first Weapons Tactics Instructors course ([WTI]) was conducted at [MCAS] [Yuma] in order to [hone] the skills of USMC avaition units. Conducting this training required over 2,000 Marines to decend annually upon the beautiful village of Yuma, AZ during the month of October. 
	
	Enter the [Yummies]:
	
	Several years after the first of these WTI training evolutions passed, word began to spread among an obese, low income, and morally corrupt segment of the Yuma female population that October is prime time to hit the bars. Over the last two decades these women have preyed upon drunken lonely Marines. 
	
	Why Yummies?
	
	The name Yuma Yummies has become popular because of its poetic use of alliteration, the fact that Yummies are similar in composition to Gummy Bears, as well as the obvious fact that Yummies are not yummy at all, but heinous half-human, half-bovine creatures with low self-respect and even lower centers of gravity.       
		Example: Yuma Yummies usually travel in herds, can be seen at local watering holes such as Jimmy [Deans] and [Applebees]. Oblivious to their large size, they receive their confidence from the knowledge that every year will bring a [new crop] of Marines.

	(2018-01-23 +19/-6)
	[yooma] yuumaes, noun. Yuma Yummies ([YY's]) can be found preying on their favorite victims gullible young horny Marines in any [local watering hole] in the South-western reaches of the Arizona desert.
	
	YY's can be usually be identified by their painted eyebrows (sometimes tattooed) giving them a facial expression of constant surprise.
	
	Some YY's have evolved, abstaining from this technique making themselves unidentifiable from your typical Yummy. These deceiving [hoodwinks] are harder to identify, but is still possible. One can only be certain when observing a true specimen in its disrobed form. Take extreme caution during this procedure. Careless can lead to the YY's favorite move; unprotected sex, which can lead to impregnation or herpes. In most cases, both.
	
	When disrobing a [YY], one must first ensure that you have clear means for a [quick getaway] by unlocking the door. All Yuma Yummies will have identifying marks known in the animal world as "stretch marks", usually caused by extreme obesity or pregnancy. In most cases both. Once a stretch mark has been positively identified, vacate the Motel 6 immediately! Do not grab your clothes, just get your cellphone and wallet and run like a [MF'r]. Cardio is going to be your saving grace as these heifers have none whatsoever. Note: the key to this maneuver is to stay at least arm's length distance away from any disrobed YY.
	
	Follow these tips and any astute Marine can avoid the detestable [Yuma Yummy].
		Example: I was [cornered] by a group of Yuma Yummies [in heat] and saved myself by throwing my wingman into [the herd] of and running away.

Yuppies usually have extremely [gay names] like Spencer, Hunter, Chad, Link, Randolph, Tucker, etc. They thoroughly enjoy money and flaunting just how much many they have. Like the Nazis were responsible for the Holocaust, yuppies are responsible for gentrification. They usually move into ethnic, working-class neighborhoods, purchase these low cost houses, knock them down and build luxury condos. They move here for a taste of culture and "[urbanity]," but then they wonder where all the culture has gone when the blue collar natives were forced to move away due to rising property taxes and no where to live.  Places faced by this [plag] include: SoHo, [Hell's Kitchen], [Charlestown] (MA).

	So you want to be a Yuppie? Here's what you have to do.
	Never act masculine. Masculine is macho, you know, and all the soccer moms just HATE anything masculine.
	Never learn how to drive a [stick shift] like a man. Drive a wussy automatic, just like an old grandma. Or a chimpanzee. Step on your brakes all the time, just like an old lady. Ride your brakes going down all hills. Never learn how to [gear down] your transmission or take it out of overdrive.
	Cultivate arrogance. Wear it on your face as a smug expression. Always talk down to waiters and service people, to let them know you're a [hot-shit] Yuppie. To prove your worth, always blow a [trumpet fanfare] when you lock your car. Be the first Yuppie on the block to buy a set of trumpets that blow when you lock your house. Everyone wants to hear trumpets, and they will all look up to you in awe and admiration.
	Always [jabber] and [prattle] on your cell phone like an old lady gossiping. Everyone who sees you will admire you.
	Learn to call problems "issues," just like a soccer mom. All the soccer moms will admire you for that.
	Tell everyone you're [going on vacation] in Cancun or St. Tropez. That will surely score you [big points] with the soccer moms.
	Always carry a PDA. The more useless things it does, the better. Show everyone how it can dial a phone and remind you it's time to go for your manicure. For extra points, let it remind you to go for a pedicure.
	When a crowd is listening, pick up your cell phone and talk LOUDLY. Say "buy 40,000 shares of IBM."
	Wherever you go, assume an air of entitlement. You are entitled to take your dog inside stores, despite the NO DOGS signs. You are entitled to use your cell phone in the movies. You are entitled to two parking spaces.
		Example: Trent is an [insipid], [smirking] Yuppie. He is entitled to park his Lexus in the handicap [parking place] because he'll only be in the store for 20 minutes.

	[Yuppie scum] comes in many forms. They tend to be separated from philistines by a greater income, a higher intelligence, higher education, and a greater appreciation of the arts. But any amongst these is not always the case.
	But like the [philistine], people who are [yuppie scum] are big time conformists and often times care little for the environment (unless they somehow feel that their momentary gain is significantly worth their efforts.) They are very materialistic, constantly overconsuming that which takes relatively little time [to get tossed] in the trash. [Yuppie Scum] buy, or build, a newer, larger house every two or three years or so, with little concern for the effect this has on the land (see McMansion.) They love, and are a driving force behind many of the demolition, renovation  and anti "clutter" shows on such channels as TLC, [HGTV], and sometimes even the Discovery Channel among others. If an older house exists that they buy, they will either [tear it down] to build a newer, larger house, or destroy anything that makes it distinctive (or as they see it, "dated".) They will also tear out bushes and trees that have been growing there for decades, generations even, and are still perfectly healthy! Yuppie scum typically care little for historic preservation. In fact, yuppie scum have done great damage by tearing down [aeons] old buildings in places like Nantucket, and replacing them with Tennis Courts etc. They can do whatever they want, they're rich.
	Yuppie scum have a tendency to wear dull, conservative, buisinesslike  attire. To see how yuppie scum like to dress, just watch Stacy and Clinton on [What Not to Wear]. They often drive large, pretentious, gas guzzling vehicles like Hummers. 
	Yuppie Scum is a varied and diverse group. They are usually 
	nouveau riche but can also be bluebloods.
	Among them can be found many different groups, among them are:
	
	Middle aged baby boomer men who diorced their 1st wives for a much younger trophy wife (see the Donald)
	
	Soccer Moms (who are often [trophy wives] themselves) who drive up the price of gasoline with their huge SUVs, and somtimes breed like rabbits 
	
	"Homebuilders", real estate or property Developers and others who gain instant gratification and wealth from the rape of the land. 
	
	Anyone who lives by "[Curb Appeal]," "What Not to Wear," "Designed to Sell" and other similar programs.
	
	Anyone on the wealthy side who is [upwardly mobile] and has only limited concern for those less fortunate or well off than themselves (except when an act somehow selfishly has an advantageous effect on themselves.)
		Example: Honda Elements may "fit" into the [compact] spaces in a parking lot, but they're not exactly compacts. [Grr]. How many times have I had to squeeze out of the door of my actual compact because an [SUV] has been parked too close to me by some yuppie scum?

But, [when push comes to shove] they would just call their precious police or cry like little bitches.

	A [hipster] with [dental] [insurance].
		Example: For the [budding] yupster, a job at Yankelovich means plane tickets to [Coachella] and no more worries about getting that [root canal].

	(2006-07-07 +210/-61)
	A professional working hipster.  Yupsters are generally in their middle 30's to very early 40's.  At the [leading edge] of Generation X, yupsters came of age during the first wave of indie rock and hip hop.  Informed by their teenage-twentysomething, DIY, cheap and chic style, yupsters have incorported their edgier pasts into a new form of an extended youth culture of hip clothes, [avante] rock, indie hop and creative class professions.  Yupsters have successfully opened sleek boutique hotels, cool [bodegas], retro diner style restaurants, vintage clothing stores, [kitschy] [bric-a-brac] retail spaces, tongue-in-cheek bars and lounges, [haute] hair salons, trendy record stores and labels, hip coffee bars and bakeries, plush pet shops and ironic graphic and design firms.  Other yupsters are employed by corporations that are drawn to the creative talents of a casually styled, slightly aged, still [youngish], urban workforce.  Yupsters live everywhere, but in the United States, they tend to gravitate to the cities of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Minneapolis, Austin, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle.  Yupsters who have children fashion them to look stylish and trendy (e.g., skater, mod, late 1970's).  Yupsters who have pets adorn them with trendy collars and accesories (e.g., [modernist] collars and couture pet bags).  Yupsters who drive, own vehicles that range from the modern and savvy [Volkswagen Passat], Mini Cooper or Vespa to the well kept, vintage Volvo or Vespa.  Yupsters define their style by combining the high and low of the vintage and modern.  A yupster would deny being a yupster for fear of questioning originality, admitting to ridiculous hair and aging into middle age.    
		Example: I realized I was a yupster when my friends and I opened up a hip bodega in an old storefront.  We sell PBR alongside Veuve [Clicquot], imported cigarettes, organic produce, free range meat and snacks from Mexico, Germany and Japan.  We hired a DJ to play nostalgia music from the 1950's on Wednesday afternoons and another to play [no wave] and hip hop on Friday evenings.  Our delicatessen is open late and features [macaroni and] chesse, Indonesian street food, Southern-fried chicken and burritos.  Our bodega has a Myspace.com account.    

	(2006-04-18 +157/-68)
	When your jeans cost more than your [iPod] and your coffee cost more than your [t-shirt], you're a yupster.
	([yuppie] + hipster)

	Short for Young Urban Professional, they tend to stray away from their parent's traditions and accept a more [ecclectic] lifestyle paying outrageous amounts of money for coffee, clothes, and other things.
		Example: [Robbie] the yupster had to check his email to see if his order for his [custom] [Marc Ecko] shirt had gone through, so he decided to go to Starbucks to grab some coffee as well.

	(2010-04-29 +23/-18)

	A complete [bastardisation] of the english language, [yurr] is a multipurpose word, bought into existance by 'Stanford'.
	It has literally thousands of uses, ranging from jovialation to blind frustrated anger.
	
	1. [Yurr]. On it's own.
	On its own, Yurr means 'Yes' or 'Yeah'. Used to casually agree or confirm a fact, or with an exclamation mark  added to the end or alternatively used in a much more positive tone, to jovialate over a point.
	
	2. Using a prefix.
	Usually, yu- is a very commonly used prefix to the word 'yurr', usually resulting in 'yu-yu-yurr' or similar.
	Alternatively, adding an 'oh-' prefix. Abit like changing 'yes' into 'hell yes'. However, don't [get carried away] adding too many yu-'s, or else you will sound like a deranged or crazed seal.
	
	(Alternative Prefixes: 
	Fuck yurr.
	When used after an insult, such as fuck,  yurr changes from 'yes' to 'you'. In such occasion, call the person saying this to you a 'twat', 'man-whore' or other appropriate insult.
	
	<insert name> yurr!
	Expressing jovialation towards a certain person.)
	
	3. Using a Suffix.
	Is'nt recommended. As you'll probably sound like a tit. Yurr is like a full-stop, [proving a point], finishing a sentance and annoucning to the world that you're different (although you quite [blatently] [are'nt]). So using a suffix is just... well... bollocks really.

		'Yu-yu-yurr!' (Extremely Happy)

	It's only ever closeted trans people with internalised transphobia who try to use it as a genuine insult.
		Example: Example 1
		[Trans man]: Someone called me "she" today... I could use some extra validation, [please and thank you].
		LGBTQIA+ ally: YWNBAW :)
		Trans man: Thanks so much. It's really nice that I have such supportive friends.
		
		Example 2
		Closeted trans person: YWNBAW.
		LGBTQIA+ ally: Hey, you know your gender is valid, right? You don't have to [misgender] your fellow trans people, we're all here to support you even if you're struggling right now.
		Closeted trans person: Gosh, you're right. I've got to get over my internalised transphobia...
		
		Example 3
		Person outside the LGBTQIA+ community: OMG, I heard you're trans! YWNBAW!!
		Trans woman: Thanks for trying. I know you mean well...
