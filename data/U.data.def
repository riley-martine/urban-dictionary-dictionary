U of D Jesuit
	(2007-12-30 +247/-77)
	A private, [jesuit], college prep high school (one of few) still located in the actual city of Detroit. If you're looking for an ad of this school, check wikipedia.. if you want the real low down keep reading.
	
	U of D draws in kids from the slums of detroit all the way to the rich kids in [Grosse Pointe] and [Bloomfield hills], and everywhere in between.
	The kids who go here can pretty much be separated into:
	
	Rich kids: If from [Bloomfield Hills], they probably go here because they dont have the humility to go to public school, ([Brother rice] may as well be included as a public school), want a better education than [Notre Dame Prep], don't want to become a shallow (explainably) stereotyped Country [day Kid], or cant afford/dont want to pay 20 grand to go to [Cranbrook]. 
	If from Grosse Pointe, they probably go to U of D because they want to go to private school, and the only other one in the area is University [Liggett], which they probably don't want to pay the 20 grand tuition for either.
	
	Middle Class Suburban kids: scarcest of the bunch. Most of the kids from these areas are either scared of the prospect of a private school in general or more specifically of Detroit in the case of U of D. Range all the way from Canton to Rochester.
	
	Detroiters: AKA the black kids. Surprisingly, most of them arent the athletes, although a good number are, and are on scholarship. A lot of them are legit, and cool to be around then there are the fake ones from nice parts of Detroit that try to fit in and make idiots of themselves doing so. They go here because plain and simply, Detroit Public Schools are [garbo].
	
	U of D has more diversity than arguably any school in Michigan, in terms of ethnicity and culture. It hosts one of the finest educations in the state and had 8 national merit semi finalists in 2007.
	
	SPORTS: 
	The U of D [student section] is THE MOST spirited in the catholic league. Although the football team went 0-9 in 2007, anyone who went to the games would have seen packed bleachers filled with kids, painted chest and all, screaming and cheering for the life of them.
	U of D's best sports are probably basketball, baseball, golf, hockey and the lacrosse team is showing promise.
	
	 It (speaking from experience) is the most fun I have ever had in my life. the brotherhood formed between the students is incomparable. CC and Bro Rice hate on U of D, but hey a little jealousy is understandable.
	
	
		Example: "look how close [those guys] are... almost like [brothers]"
		"I think they [go to] U of D Jesuit"

U2
	(2008-05-06 +199/-58)
	An Irish rock band that formed as Feedback in 1976.  By 1979, the band changed its name to U2 after Paul McGuiness became manager.  The band's lineup is Bono, vocals, occasional guitar, The Edge, lead guitar, backing vocals, [Adam Clayton], bass, [Larry Mullen Jr]., drums.
	
	In 1980 U2 released its first album, Boy.  Since then, their most famous works have been The Joshua Tree, 1987, Achtung Baby, 1991, and All that you can't Leave Behind, 2000.  U2 have sold more than 50 million albums in the United States and their tours often sell out quickly.  Currently, U2 is still active and working on a new album.  Their lineup has remained the same since 1979.
	
	Some hits include: I will Follow, New Year's Day, [Sunday Bloody Sunday], Pride (In the Name of Love), With or Without You, Where the Streets have no Name, Desire, One, Mysterious Ways, Beautiful Day, The Sweetest Thing, and Vertigo.
		Example: "[Screw this]!  U2 tickets [sold out] in like [12 seconds]."

	(2006-11-04 +518/-172)
	U2 is a successful, four-member Irish rock band formed in Dublin in the late 1970s.
	
	Mention of this band generally polarizes opinion, with die hard fans referring to them as [the greatest band in the world] and non-fans referring to them as the worst, most pompous, least talented or most annoying band in the world. ([U2's] political activism produces the same [disparity] of opinion.)
	
	NOTE: The second paragraph of this definition can be applied to most rock bands and various other celebrities, because it is apparently not enough for the human animal to say, "No, I don't care for ____" (fill in the blank) and leave it at that; the dislike must seemingly be expressed in hearty invective and insults as creative and inflammatory as the writer can produce. This behavior can be noted in most entries at Urban Dictionary which concern rock bands.
		Example: Fan: I love U2 (or other band that fan is [enamored] of), they are [the greatest band in the world]!
		[Non-fan]: I hate them, they suck, they're awful and talentless and ugly and stupid and annoying and... (and so forth.)

	(2004-12-26 +1763/-821)
	An Irish Rock Band- there are 2 well known definitions.
	
	1)Releasing many successful albums over 2 decades and continuing to perform their beautifully constructed songs with passion and a complete genuine belief in their lyrics- one of the greatest rock bands of our time.
	
	some people (usually people who dislike Bonoand are so busy calling him a pompous [self righteous] arse that they fail to realise that they themselves are behaving like pompous self rightous arses.....or people who are [half deaf]) would use this definition for U2-
	
	2)U2 r a overrated sucky Irash band [wiv] know talunt. Whhadayamean I cant sppell? I can sppell as gud as I can [revew] [moosic]...
	
	Definition number one is probably the more popular of the two. Mainly because it is the most accurate one.
		Example: 1) "I am going to see U2- the greatest band on the planet- tonight."
		
		2)"I hate U2...their lyrics are dumb. But [the Wiggles] [rock] [my world]. So deep..."

	(2004-10-16 +1006/-468)
	1) A [spy plane] still in service today.
	
	2) One of the greatest rock bands ever, maybe even the greatest. I know they're the greatest band ever to come out Ireland, they achived popular [sucess] and much fame... however, they don't care about the money or the drugs, they care about us and our world... they have a great political stance.. [Bono] stands up for many causes escipally in thrid-world countries (mostly African).
		Example: 1) A U2 [flown] by Francis Gary Powers was shot down over the USSR in 1960.
		
		2)"I'm gonna go get How to [Dismantle] an [Atomic Bomb] when it comes out beucase U2 rocks."

	(2009-05-08 +116/-53)
	U2 is a four member Irish [rock band] that has been fairly successful so far. I wouldn't go as far as calling them [the best band in the world], But they are in [the top 5] anyways.

		Yeah. They [rock].

	(2006-11-13 +213/-131)
	[the greatest band in the world] right now - while there's crappy nu-metal, [corporate pop], hat acts, violence and kinky sex (and other things) glorifying rap, emo, poserpunk and other trash - then there's U2. They are true originals, their lyrics tend to lean to the spiritual side (as well as being mature and intelligent in the first place), and the guitarist is the aptly named "Edge". They hail from Dublin, Ireland and have been together for over 30 years and they  still make top-quality rock and roll. That's right, the most innovative, original and inspiring rock supergroup in the past 3 decades doesn't come from America, doesn't come from Britain, but from Ireland. Imagine that. I saw them  in concert twice and they kick the crap out of [today's music] anyday. Oh, and did I forget to say - U2 ROCKS!

Ubermensch
	(2012-12-23 +822/-97)
	The Ubermensch is [Friedrich Nietzsche's] answer to the problem of Nihilism. Nietzsche begins his premise with the assumption that God does not exist, and if God does not exist, thus [objective morality] and inherent value are not possible since there is no ultimate being that exists to create morality and value in the first place.
	[Nietzsche's] Ubermensch will act as his own God, giving himself morality and value as he sees fit according to him alone. The Ubermensch is neither slave or master as he does not impose his will upon others. The Ubermensch is an independent individual who has the power to banish herd instincts from his mind and become a master of self discipline.
	
	Above all, the Ubermensch is the next step in human evolution. Every human must deal with the question "What is the meaning of life"- some say God and Heaven, others say ultimate objective virtue, but the Ubermensch will give life value that is not based on superstition or mystical folly. The Ubermensch finds value in his life experience because it cannot be reasoned out through argument and logic. The Ubermensch would say that the meaning of life is that you die, so make it valuable.
		Example: The Ubermensch is the opposite of Jesus Christ.
		
		The Ubermensch is the ultimate realization of [the Will to] Power, but no necessarily over others. His most valuable power is over himself. "He cannot rule himself will [certainty] be ruled by others"- [Nietzsche]

	(2005-04-06 +679/-292)
	[Nietzsche's] concept for "an over man" who overcomes [the herd] perspective and is capable of creating a new perspective without [dogmatically] forcing his perspective on others.
		Example: In [Thus Spake Zarathustra], Zaruthustra attempts to become an Ubermensch.

	(2003-10-13 +153/-135)
	One [who cares] not for the [morality] of common [Untermensch] because he introspectively understands what is right and wrong.
		Example: Only the Ubermensch are capable of fully understanding [Nietzschean] [philosophy]. All others fear it and attempt to discredit it through [petty] insults and misinterpretation.

	(2003-05-04 +153/-150)
	The [overman], for Nietzsche, did not and could not exist as a contemporary, since he saw himself as living in decadent times incapable of spawning ones who were capable of "standing security for their own destiny."  Personally, i would suggest that the [Overman] would be one who could bear the horror of memory and [cognizance] of the present while simultaneously retaining the vigor and purpose of those who Nietzsche describes as nobles in "The Genealogy of Morals."
		Example: Examples are not helpful.  German foot soldiers in WWI carried copies of "[Thus Spake Zarathustra]."  The [twentieth century] bears witness to the idiocy of [Nietzsche] interpreters...

	(2003-05-02 +63/-107)
	It's "over" man..as in [a man] [in control] OVER his own [world].
		Example: The Ubermensch [walked] with an [air] that [set] him apart

	(2003-07-18 +56/-114)
	It's not "[uber]", it's ü[ber]! And stop pronouncing it "[oober]".
		Example: [Du] [bist] [kein] übermensch!

	(2005-04-10 +29/-74)
	Like the [afore] stated it was introduced by Nietzsche in his book [Thus Spake Zarathustra] to simplify of course the [ubermensch] in modern terms would be one who is self actualized and spreads his influence to those around him
		Example: Me...[just kidding] [I know] [none]

	(2003-04-29 +27/-74)
	Ubermensch is [a German] word meaning "[Superman]" or "[super man]".
		Example: Ubermensch [ist] [lustig]!

	(2003-04-21 +29/-88)
	Expressed by the philosipher [Nietzche] as the one who has perfect virtues.
	
	This would, [of course], mean that the Ubermensch would certianly not be [rascist].
		Example: Next time, check yo facts befo' yo be writin a definition for [suhuh] you know [nuthin] about. [Do it again] and I go all Ubermensch on ya.

	An übersexuals is a manly man who displays all the good qualities associated with the gender without giving into the negative stereotypes such as [chauvinism], emotional unavailability and a brain only filled with sports stats, beer and burgers. Compared with the metrosexual, the übersexual is more into relationships than self. It is a masculinity that combines the best of traditional manliness (strength, honor, character) with positive traits traditionally associated with females such as nurturance, communicativeness, and co-operation. 
	He merely is a gentleman in all manners of the definition. A [ubersexual] is a man that knows masculinity is not about being rude and dirty, but being a well dressed, well groomed gentleman. Also known for their cunnilingus skills, but both meanings of course...many languages, and giving pleasure with the tongue. Ubersexuals make the best boyfriends ever. They really know how to take care of themselves and their Girl friend. 
	
	Here are six quick and easy ways to tell the difference between being ubersexual and metrosexual: 
	
	1. Both are passionate, but the ubersexual is passionate about causes and principles. 
	
	2. The ubersexual spends more time grooming his mind than his hair. 
	
	3. Both treat and [respect women] as equals, but the ubersexual considers other men, and women, his best friends. 
	
	4. The ubersexual is more sensual and not at all self-conscious. He doesn't need other people to tell him he's sexy. 
	
	5. The metrosexual gets his design tips from [the Fab Five], the design gurus from [Queer Eye for the Straight Guy]. Ubersexuals get their ideas from travels and interest in art and culture. 
	
	6. The ubersexual knows the difference between right and wrong and will make the right decision regardless of what others around him may think. The metrosexual knows the difference between [toner] and [exfoliant]. 
	
		Example: The current icon of Übersexuals is Bono. He's global, [socially aware], confident, and compassionate, and he commands a huge base of followers who are fans of his music and his humanitarianism. Other notable ubersexuals are Bill Clinton, George Clooney, Jon Stewart, [Pierce Brosnan], Donald Trump, and [Ewan McGregor].

	(2006-01-04 +75/-71)
	a male who has [good taste] in clothes,and other qualities that are normally associated with the female gender, but still has the qualtites that [declare] his manhood. Similar to [metro], but there is no question of his sexuality he is straight

	(2010-06-15 +12/-10)
	A term coined as in response to male (mainly straight) insecurity of sexuality. The term is supposed to be applied to "straight" males and is supposed to be a step on from the metrosexual - which is a straight guy who's not afraid to be mistaken for gay.
	
	Ubersexuals are supposed to be real men and [embody] the qualities of real men; confidence - like [Alexander the Great]; decisiveness, like Alexander the Great; but who are also in touch with their feminine sides and [a wow] with the "ladies" - like Alexander the Great... But they are straight - no mistaking - because they embody the best of (Uber) manhood; displaying the traditional manly qualities such as confidence, strength, and class - leaving no doubt as to thier (straight) sexual orientation.
		Example: Not [Alexander the Great]; Not Marlon Brando; definitely not Casanova - he'd probably qualify as metrosexual anyhow; Not [Hadrian] (Emperor of the wall), and of course you can forget the really obvious ones like [Rock Hudson]: Or anyone in a rock band...
		
		...apart from Bono who is apparently the worlds leading Ubersexual... cause anyone in the performing arts doesn't qualify for consideration of normaly manliness - unless it's Bono of course but then he is the worlds leading...

ubuntard
	(2007-12-29 +56/-14)
	Users, usually new to [GNU/Linux] and FOSS who confuse common applications with their existence on the Ubuntu distribution.  Generally this can be combated by making it explicit that said applications are found on all GNU/Linux distributions. 
	
	Can also be associated with users who are under the impression that Ubuntu is superior to all other GNU/Linux distributions despite the fact that said distributions are tailored for specific requirements. In reality none are superior/inferior, just built for different requirements. Eg [Gentoo] for optimizing for hardware, Debian/[Slackware]/Fedora for reliability, {U|Ku|[Xu]}[buntu]/Mint for user friendliness, etc.
		Example: "which one is better [Xgl]/Compiz or [Ubuntu Linux]?"
		
		[Ubuntard] looking at a generic distro using GNOME as the DE: "OMG are you using Ubuntu?!"
		
		

	(2009-04-02 +30/-8)
	[Ubuntard] is a concatenation of "[Ubuntu]" and "Retard." 
	
	BACKGROUND:
	
	Ubuntu is a piece of software called an operating system. An operating system that most are generally familiar with is Microsoft Windows. Ubuntu is part of the [GNU/Linux] family of operating systems, and it is designed to be easy to use for those who are not particularly computer-savvy, yet easily customizable for experts.
	
	Retards are people who are [developmentally challenged], which means that they may not comprehend everyday happenings and thoughts at the level of what society's normal folk do. They may also act like children by throwing tantrums, thinking they're always right, being hypocritical, etc.
	
	[FOREGROUND]:
	
	An [ubuntard] is a special kind of computer user. They are users of the GNU/Linux distribution Ubuntu, however this is not the only defining characteristic. To be called an ubuntard you must generally believe you are an expert in the field of IT, computer science, or the Linux OS in general strictly because you use Ubuntu to browse the web, chat with your buddies, and do other [end user] things. Ubuntards generally congregate in the Linux/Unix area of the Technology portion of digg.com. You can observe them there in their natural habitat where they normally won't get called out on their 'buntardism by real experts, which in comparison to 'buntards are few in number on [digg's] tech area.
	
	You may have noticed that you can shorten ubuntard with 'buntard. It sounds like boon-tard, and is far easier to say in conversation.
		Example: Man, this fucking ubuntard thinks he is [Linus Torvalds] cause he uses [Firefox] on [Ubuntu], yet doesn't know what bash is.

	A member of the order of Ubuntu, the most devout of the celibate tribes. Followers often tend to live in small packs, often dominated by a [matriarch], who by custom, lives in the upper floor of the domicile for twenty to thirty years; although, studies have proven cases often have lifetime arrangements. Members of this order are rarely seen during in the daylight while they practice a self-mutilating practice, performed mostly with thumbs and the use of a biofeedback video device. The most commonly witnessed activity by outsiders, a [routine 2] a.m. trip to the corner-shop is known as “[nocturnal emission]” within the [tome] of listed rituals. The order preaches it was actually a third lineage of beings that evolved separately from Homo sapiens and the line of apes and other primates.

		Example: UC Berkeley, [yeah]....

	(2013-08-26 +55/-126)
	[Berkeley's] [Chinatown] disguised as a University that used to have a racially diverse student body that protested against social issues back in the 70's. Now its just Chinese kids trying to get medical degrees and Indians trying to get engineering degrees. This is especially obvious the minute you walk out of UC Berkeley and notice that sudden abnormal re-occurrence of Black and White people, and some Asian Americans here and there.
	Haven for Asian Foreigners.
	They tried to make it more diverse by being 'officially racist' and just give Asians higher test goals. (see: [Affirmative Action]) Funny thing is, it didn't even work.
	
	Still an awesome school to go to however, just don't expect to be able to speak their official language, 'Mandarin.'
		Example: Out-of-State student: "Woah, there's a lot of Asians at UC [Berkeley], jeez, look at this campus. So this is what California's racial demographics are like"

UC Gay-vis
	(2011-03-14 +50/-29)
	A derogatory name for [UC Davis], used by some disgruntled moron on UrbanDictionary who speaks poor English, hates Asians, and can't spell Berkeley correctly. UC Davis students are among the most [laid-back] and friendly students in the [UC] system, and the education and research opportunities are top notch -- well worthy of the UC label.
		Example: [The other guy]: I hate UC Gay-vis. [Forever].
		
		Me: Then [don't go there].

_____

UC Davis
	(2008-02-26 +7821/-131)
	A four-year institution of higher learning located in [California's] [Central Valley]. Currently ranked as the fourth best campus in the University of California system. [Davis] has acquired a reputation as a bike-friendly campus and is often stereotyped as constantly smelling like cow shit (although this only true if it rains or unless you happen to live in the Tercero housing complex). The students at UC Davis are called [Aggies], however the campus mascot is actually a mustang named [Gunrock] which has nothing to do with the title "[Aggie]". This leaves Davis students in the awkward predicament of having to explain to non-Davis individuals why their mascot is a horse and what the hell an Aggie is when the vast majority probably haven't a foggy damn. Davis is also perenially labeled as the "school for Berkeley rejects" and a common saying is that "Davis is no one's first choice." Despite this snobbish labeling of the campus by outsiders, Davis students have a reasonable amount of school spirit and school pride.
	
	The academics in Davis are somewhat in line with the rest of the other [UC's] in that they are competitive, challenging, and that you can be assured that if you slack off, some [super nerd] is going to set the exam curve at 98% therefore screwing you over. However unlike Berkeley, Davis students are somewhat more willing to help others with work and the sense of violent [cutthroat] competition that one might expect at a university of [UCD's] caliber is notably absent. UC Davis is largely noted for its veterinary/animal science department, agriculture school, and its Viticulture and Enology Department (aka the study of wine). The VEN 003 course is always popular amongst freshmen who think it's going to be a chill laid back class about alcohol and then end up getting frustrated once they fail their first midterm because they couldn't remember what type of grapes are used to make oloroso sherry ([Palomino]). 
	
	UC Davis also fields a number of teams in different sports and is notable as being the only UC campus to field a football team after Cal and UCLA. The transition from [Div] II to Div I occurred in 2007 and the Aggies now play at a much more competitive level regarding sports. The main rival for all [UCD] athletes are the Sacramento State [Hornets] who annually play the Aggies in football in the [Causeway] Classic. It should be noted that UCD leads all time 39-17 in the Classic and has destroyed [Sac State] for eight years in a row. Other rivals include [Cal Poly] and any other university with the word "state" in its name. 
	
	Davis is an example of a true college town; once classes let out following spring quarter, the town empties as thousands of students and faculty flee the summer heat and crushing boredom of the Central Valley for cooler and more entertaining destinations. Activities in Davis are limited by the town's size; bowling at the MU, eating downtown, going to the movies, and drinking (at house parties or bars) are staples of most students' lives. UC Davis also has a number of student clubs, IM and club sports teams, the Band-uh! and some  roughly 40 recognized [sororities and fraternities] for those students who seek to be more involved in their campus. 
	
	On the whole, it's a very underrated campus, an excellent place to get an education, and no, the students do not go [cow tipping].
		Example: Non-Davis Guy: "So where do you go to school?"
		[Davis] Student: "UC Davis."
		Non-Davis Guy: "Wtf, isn't that like a total hick school where you guys tip cows all day and shit?"
		Davis Student: ".....[shut the hell up] before I [backhand] your ignorant ass."

	(2010-04-25 +362/-96)
	A University completely underrated. [UC] Davis is often hated on by people who aren't smart enough to get in or by [Cal Poly] students. If any of those people had ever actually visited the college they would see how amazing it is and how diverse the people are. One thing all can agree on is that it does smell like [cow shit] often, but the top of the line academics and ridiculously intelligent student body ([give or take] a few athletes) surpass that smell.
	
	Contrary to what some of the prior posts say, UC Davis is many peoples' first choice and many choose it over Cal because of the fact that you can walk around the town without getting harassed by a homeless person, and for its insane pre-vet and overall science programs.
	
	UC Davis is often considered the fourth best UC, behind [SD]...but the only thing SD is known for is having zero school pride and terrible([D3]) athletics.
		Example: Person 1: I go to UC Davis
		
		Person 2: [Oh so] you have crazy competitive academics, superior faculty, amazing food, a sick [campus], a bike waiting to be stolen, and way too much [school spirit]
		
		Person 1: Pretty much...

	(2009-04-01 +131/-893)
	A UC that is ranked higher than it should be, in a city that smells like shit.  It usually gets its [ass handed] to by [Cal Poly] in the Golden Horseshoe football game.  Just another UC in the shadow of [UCB] and UCLA.
		Example: [Welcome] to UC Davis! A place for [cow shit], [asians], and bicycles.

uc san diego
	(2016-03-13 +62/-0)
	Located on an oceanside cliff in sunny La Jolla, [UC San Diego] is one of the world's top institutions for producing researchers, innovators, and awkward engineers. It is consistently ranked #1 by Washington Monthly, a magazine that nobody reads. As California's unofficial science department, UCSD research discovered the first evidence for climate change, the cause of diabetes, and a colony of endangered ants living in Chancellor [Khosla's] mustache. Its mascot, King Triton, is well-known as the most badass eunuch of all time.
	
	UC San Diego is minutes from most of San Diego's world-class attractions. But if you're looking for UCSD students, you'll find them napping at Black's Beach wishing they could surf, waiting in line at [TapEx], or hiding from social interaction in Geisel Library. Despite not having a football team, students find things to do, like studying for midterms between raves.
	
	UCSD was designed with a unique six-college system, to give freshmen an easy conversation starter. These colleges ([Revelle], Muir, Marshall, Warren, Roosevelt, Sixth) are considered pretty equal, except for Sixth. Campus-wide traditions like the legendary [Sun God Festival] unite the colleges as one university.
	
	Out of its 200,000 graduates, UCSD has produced exactly four famous alumni: Nick Woodman, who founded GoPro, and those three interchangeable Asians from [Wong Fu Productions]. The other 199,996 are all out there somewhere, still complaining about not having gotten into Berkeley.
		Example: Even with [triton eye], it's harder to find a [parking spot] than a hot girl at [UC San Diego].

UC Merced

	When you get [rejected] at [every other] [UC].
		Example: What? Even [Santa Cruz] [rejected] me? [I guess] I'll go to UC Merced.

	(2018-08-30 +37/-27)
	The ass crack of the UC system. Developed with great intentions, finished with sadness. Typical students include the not-so-smart-Asian kids, Central Valley [underachievers], coastline idiots, and compulsive procrastinators. Due to its location in ? Like actually though, where the fuck is [Merced]. Exactly, you don’t even know. Go look it up, I’ll wait. Yeah we have giant crosses that say “Jesus Saves” next door. Despite all this, UC Merced still parties hard due to the lack of [literally anything else] to do and high convenience store workers that don’t ID anyone. Come here if you sucked at high school, want to party, and think you might transfer but will end up staying bc your rent is $400 a month for a big ass house.
		Example: You know that Johnny kid whose parents are [doctors]? I heard his parents [disowned] him because he only got into UC Merced. Good thing I’m going to the highly accredited university- [Chico State]!

	(2010-11-23 +90/-130)
	The newest of the [UC's] and the easiest to get into. Because of the largest club on campus is [a Christian] club, and the majority of students falling into [the order] of Asian, Mexican/Hispanic, University of Christian Minorities has become the new place to go.
		Example: Did you [get into] UC Merced?
		Yeah, but there are [too many] [Christian] minorities.

	The Best [UC] in [California] with [the Sexiest] men and Women.
		Example: UC Merced [got some] [hot] as people that are [smart] too!!!

	(2011-04-15 +149/-226)
	The anus of the UC system, a deprived crap-hole of subpar academic misery and social depravity that is accepting anyone who applies. The typical student was rejected from every other UC but wanted to pander to the fact that they attended a school with the "name" that implies prestige (when in fact none exists at all) but in reality offers nothing but subpar academics, shitty and socially isolating location and a laughable four year college experience. Did I mention UC Merced is being considered for the [chopping block]? Bet the Regents wish they could have seen the financial cuts coming! Merced will be the [bellwether] for the great [budget deficit] of our time.
		Example: Guy 1: Dude, I got rejected from all my [top schools]. And even [SDSU] and [Cal Poly]
		Guy 2: Bro, that sucks to be you. So where are you headed?
		Guy 1: UC Merced! But I'm probably going to transfer out...

	University of California, [Merced]. [Brand new], just started in 2005. Whether people will want to spend [four years] in Merced is anybody's guess at this point.

		Person 2: Have you applied to UC Merced?

UC Santa Cruz
	(2011-07-13 +115/-40)
	A 4 year university located at the top of a hill looking over [Monterey] Bay. [UCSC] is known for 420, or April 20th of every year, a day dedicated to smoking weed in a field with thousands of people to light enormous blunts and get high. UCSC is also known for its hippie-loving, liberal, feminist, and stoner stereotypes.
	
	The UC Santa Cruz mascot is a banana slug, chosen for its "docile and peaceful" nature. It basically embodies [Santa Cruz's] laid-back vibe and works perfectly as a very non-intimidating mascot since Santa Cruz has no sports teams to boast about. School pride is lacking since most of the school's population is too busy taking [bong rips] and eating munchies anyways.
	
	The school's campus itself is considered one of the most beautiful campuses in the US. The entire campus is a [redwood forest]. You'll do a lot of walking on the UCSC campus because the buses are always late and take too long anyways.
	
	UC Santa Cruz is often said to have a very quiet nightlife and weekend parties merely consist of smoking weed. If you're a stoner, that's probably true. For [the 21]+, Motiv and the [Red Room] become common bar stops. And house parties happen every weekend, its just about finding them since they’re DL because of the 10 PM city curfew.
	
	Overall an often underrated, funky college campus with good things to see and people to meet for an open-minded college student.
		Example: [Joe Shmoe]: "Its [420]@ Let's head over to UC Santa Cruz!"

	(2019-03-29 +13/-3)

	This personal statement ideally should explain why you should be accepted to the course.
	
	A UCAS whore is a person who loses all social activity and a life in order to do things to put down on their personal statement.

UCF
	(2018-12-24 +57/-6)
	1. It is a parking lot for limebikes. They are left in the craziest of places including on roofs of buildings and up trees. They mysteriously gather up in groups every knight. Some say that they are haunted.
	
	2. Knight puns. Knight puns are everywhere. Legend has it that UCF Alimni will never be able to spell the word knight without a k.
	
	3. FOOTBALL. "WE WANT 'BAMA!!!!!" UCF is undefeated and will destroy anyone in their path.
	
	4. [Under Construction] Forever, U Can't (or Can) Finish, Underrated in College Football

	5) Home of some pretty bad sports, due mostly to the fact that Orlando is so apathetic that they would rather support the Gators (who don't need more fans) than help build their own college athletics program. 
	
	
		Example: "UCF Sucks! Look at how many [Gator] decals I have !!!" 
		"Oh? What has your school done in the last 10 years? 
		UCF has built billions of dollars of academic construction projects, expanded its student body five-fold, and has competed nationally in virtually every field, and has humorously lost just about every [foot ball] game they have ever played."

Also, the [NORML] chapter at UCF is arguably the largest and best-funded student drug-policy organization in the country and was voted as the top organization by the student body.
	
	The weed at UCF is SUPREME to that of UF and FSU, which, in my opinion, matters way more than football scores. We smoke [Cali Kush], Maui Wowie, and [Grandaddy Purp] on a more regular basis than the other schools [smoke shake].
	
	A word of warning, however: the cops at UCF are pigs. Don't be stupid. If you want to make a difference, hit up your local NORML and get weed equalized, decriminalized and legalized.
	
	There's just something magical about getting stoned when you're right down the street from Disney World.
		Example: Example 1: "Yo, I'm going to UCF this weekend. Don't let me forget my pipe and papers."

uchiha itachi
	(2007-06-14 +61/-14)
	[Uchiha Itachi] is one of the main villains in the hit anime/manga series, Naruto. Currently a member of the Akatsuki organization, he seeks to unlock the true potential in his younger brother, Sasuke [Uchiha]. [Itachi], being the prodigy of the Uchiha clan, killed all of the members of his clan, aside from his younger brother Sasuke. When asked why he destroyed his clan, he simply answered, "To gauge my strength", or something to that element. He tells his younger brother that the Mangekyo [Sharingan] that he possesses is not merely a kekkai genkai, but it has a secret ultimate purpose that has yet to be revealed.
	
	The Uchiha clan specializes in [Katon] (fire) Jutsu techniques. The power of said techniques can be heightened with the use of the [Sharigan]. The Uchiha clans kekkai genkai. (blood line limit) Another, more powerful form of [the Sharingan] is the Mangekyo Sharingan, possessing the ability to cast [genjutsu] instantly without flaw. One of the techniques that Itachi favors is Tsukyomi (Moon Reader). This genjutsu technique can submerge the victim into a limitless world that Itachi has complete control over. He can distort gravity, time, existence, and creation in this world. It's absolutely impossible to dispel. 
	
	Itachi told his younger brother Sasuke that, if he was to obtain the Mangekyo Sharingan, there would be three people capable of using it. This implies that Kakashi is capable of obtaining the Mangekyo Sharingan.
		Example: [Uchiha Itachi]: "If you are to [obtain] the Mangekyo [Sharingan], there will be only 3 people on this earth capable of using it."

	(2009-03-25 +35/-18)
	A fictional character from the popular manga and anime, Naruto. [Itachi] has two things his brother will never have: a nearly unreachable level of power and good looks (I'm sorry, Sasuke fans). The prodigy is skilled in many ninjustsu, [genjutsu], and [taijutsu]. His most well known is his Tsukyomi (one of the two main techniques that come with the [Mangekyou Sharingan]), which is ultimate torture in the form of either bad memories or 72 hours of a pain of [Itachi's] choosing.
	
	Itachi's name means weasel. In Japanese culture, weasels are said to be a bad omen.
	
	The Uchiha had a thirst for power, reflected by the fact that he was willing to kill his own best friend, Uchiha [Shisui]. It was believed for a time that Itachi had murdered the rest of his clan (with the exception of Sasuke) because he is a sadistic bastard and never cared about anyone but himself. However, before his death (which was caused by his own power lust, ironically), we find out that he had been ordered to kill his family and he had only managed to have Sasuke spared because he threatened to go public with the plan to kill the Uchihas. It was also thought that Itachi murdered everyone on his own, but he did recieve a hand from [Uchiha Madara].
	
	In [Naruto Abridged] (a parody of the anime), the relationship between Sasuke and his brother is turned comedic. The duck butt-haired ninja says he hates Itachi because "he took the last Klondike bar."
	
	Itachi is among the most popular characters from Naruto, due to his strength and good looks. He appears in many fanfictions, frequently OOC. However, when he is shown as his normal stoic self in such stories, it is often because he had a troubled past, and he easily steals the spotlight of the tale.
		Example: [Jashin], that last chapter of "My Weasel" was stupid! Uchiha Itachi was really [OOC]. xItachixFanxPersonx writes even worse than [Stephanie Meyer]!

	(2007-06-28 +257/-92)
	Sasuke Uchiha. One of the main characters in the series Naruto. He is the [sole survivor] of the Uchiha clan massacre. He defines himself as an avenger. He seeks power in order to kill his older brother [Itachi Uchiha], the one that killed the clan. Sasuke posseses his clan's bloodline trait, sharingan. Due to that, he is a fast learner and is able to copy justus during battle. He is like an [aniki] (brother) to Naruto and his best friend is Naruto. In part one of the series he is 12 years old. In part two, he is 15. His profile is as followed:
	
	Birthday: July 23
	Blood Type: AB
	Height: 153.2 cm
	Weight: 43.5 kg
	Known relatives: [Fugaku] Uchiha (father, deceased), [Mikoto] Uchiha (mother, deceased), and Itachi Uchiha (brother). 
	
	His previous affiliations: [Konoha], Sound village.
	
	Abilites: Sharingan, [Chidori], Chidori Current, Fire Release: Phoenix Immortal Fire Technique, Cursed Seal (first stage and [second stage]), Snake summons (from body and giant snakes), and other fire techniques. Not all are known due to Sasuke not showing all of his current abilities. For taijutsu he knows Hayabusa Otoshi ([Peregrine Falcon] Drop), [Shishi] [Rendan] (Lion Combo, English version: Lions Barrage),  and many other techniques. 
	
	Personality: he doesn't show much affection toward girl (fangirls) except Sakura Haruno. He is willing to sacrifice himself for the sake of helping/protecting his friends (Sakura and Naruto). Beginning of the series, he believes he is much more talented than Sakura and Naruto. He craves power and doesn't speak much. He usually doesn't say anything other than "Hn." He values his teammates more than himself. He seeks strong opponents, believing each victory he obtains indicates his growth. He does not show much respect to anyone. Sasuke does not like to kill people he does not know (innocent people), and makes it a point to prevent as many deaths as possible. 
	
	He is usually described as a Bishie, or rather Bishounen. Meaning pretty boy. 
		Example: [Sasuke Uchiha] & Naruto: Sasuke Retrieval. Bring Back Sasuke To [Konoha]
		
		Sasuke: "I'm an avenger and I will do what is necessary to obtain power. I have to kill him."
		
		Naruto: "Sasuke! [Orochimaru] only wants you body as a new container."
		
		Sasuke: "If that is what is needed to kill Itachi, then so be it."
		

	(2009-02-14 +843/-425)
	One of the main characters in the anime/manga series "Naruto". When he was younger, he witnessed the murder of his entire clan at the hand of his sexy older brother, [Itachi Uchiha]. As a result he is very angsty and emotionally unstable, and desires revenge on his older brother at all costs. His teammates are Naruto Uzumaki (his best friend/rival/gay lover), Sakura Haruno (his good friend, who has a crush on him, unaware of his gayness), and [Kakashi Hatake] (his sensei/teacher/father figure).
	
	Just as Naruto starts to work his way into [Sasuke's] heart, [Orochimaru] (the son of Lord Voldemort and Michael Jackson), who desires the bloodline limit of the Uchiha clan ([the Sharingan]), approaches Sasuke during the Chuunin exams and gives him a hickey--er, Cursed Seal to give him a taste of power and put him back on the path of revenge. As a result, later in the series Sasuke joins Orochimaru, who begins to train/molest him, so he can become strong enough to kill Itachi.
	
	Despite what [rabid fangirls] wish to believe, there is no evidence that Sasuke is heterosexual. Quite the opposite, actually. Sasuke shows no interest in females, despite having legions of fangirls within the series who he could easily get into bed if he desired. Fangirls like to use the "I want to restore my clan" line as proof that Sasuke is straight, despite the fact that "restore my clan" is a very vague phrase and Sasuke has done nothing to back up his words (IF restore clan = make babies).
	
	Nearly everyone in the [Naruto fandom] hates Sasuke for being "an emo fag" and betraying his friends, and apparently they don't care that Sasuke went through overwhelming trauma as a child and is probably borderline insane. This just shows that the majority of the Naruto fandom are heartless bastards who hate what they don't understand. There are other reasons people hate Sasuke, but they're all stupid so it's pointless to state them here.
	
	This definition will have 1748354793141571894751341 thumbs down from [Sasuke haters].
		Example: Person 1: Sasuke Uchiha is such an emo fag!!1 If I were him I'd NEVER EVER EVER betray my friends!!1 And I wouldn't be so EMO if my bro killed my parents!!1 [Blahblahblah] sasuke sux [blahblah] emo crybaby blaahblahblah killed Deidei-kun-chan-sama [blahblahblah] fag blah blah *WHINE BITCH WHINE BITCH* *IS A HYPOCRITE*
		
		Person 2: ...Wow. You're the most immature, whiny emo [crybaby bitch] I've ever met. You clearly don't understand Sasuke Uchiha. :|

UCL
	(2006-03-30 +287/-175)
	University College London, the first college of the University of London. It was England's third university (after oxford and cambridge.)
	
	It was not originally recognised by the Crown as it intended to (and still does, rather surprisingly) accept people of all races, classes and genders. 
	
	There is a long standing rivalry between UCL and [King's College London] (which is like this crappy bit of [UoL], and basically is good for nothing apart from playing football with [dead people's] heads. The Wankers.)
	
	UCL is a very cool place. Everyone should worship it.
	
		Example: I am [applying] to UCL to study [medicine]
		
		Why are you applying [to King's]? UCL is FAR better! 
		

	(2010-08-30 +39/-28)

	acronym for U(you) C(see) [Lotsa] [Asians], a good description of [UC] Los Angeles.
		Example: U C [Lotsa] [Asians] at [UCLA]

	(2005-04-22 +553/-260)
	Mr. Anonymous [Trojan], check out the second page of [UCLA] definitions.  You'll find that a lot of your buddies from [USC] were making overly negative, hateful definitions about UCLA before [Trojankiller] posted his definitions.  And unlike most of the asinine comments your buddies made, his definitions are filled with "facts" about [UCLA's] academic and athletic prestige.
	
	Don't get your panties into a bunch because UCLA students don't just lie down for your abuse.  If you want to give it, you better learn to take it.  It's also ironic that you can criticize someone for using the internet while you're doing the same thing.  Insecure much?
		Example: [Trojans] get so sensitive when [UCLA] students use facts to set them straight.  [Cry me a river].

	(2005-03-12 +1045/-607)
	The real "[University of Spoiled Children]."  The students at UCLA pay a fraction of what [USC] students pay and go to a university with a better academic ranking and better faculty in a better neighborhood.  
	
	USC students have to stoop to making racist comments about Asian people to justify getting raped for tuition at an inferior school in a horrible part of LA.  Keep up that type of attitude.  It's sad how much some of you fit the Trojan stereotype.  
	
	And I guess all of those USC students on financial aid are just poor white trash.  It's good to know that you people think so much of the lower income students at your school.  
	
	Usually, being a private institution means being better.  This is not the case with USC, which has lower academic rankings than both UCLA and Cal.  As a private school, USC is an [underachiever].    You're better off not mentioning the whole private vs. public thing since it only makes you look worse.
		Example: If you want to go to the best university in the LA area, go to [UCLA].  [USC] students pay about six times the price UCLA students pay, yet the school is lower in the rankings.  Don't [get ripped] off.  Get spoiled at UCLA.

	(2006-12-05 +95/-86)
	beat 'SC on [December 2], 2006 in football ending [USC's] 7 game [winning streak]. Still holds the record of 8 games won against USC in a row.
		Example: [UCLA] gave it to [USC] in [the BOOTY]

	(2007-09-23 +107/-146)
	University of Caucasians Losing out to Asians. It's so sad that [UCLA] students think that they can vicariously experience pride through their [Nobel] laureates. It makes no sense because you UCLA students aren’t actually the ones who discovered or made [break through] advances in science or academia. Just because UCLA managed to “acquire” these elite individuals, doesn’t mean their loftiness rubs off on you guys. Stop trying to vicariously feel pride in something you didn’t achieve, or in other words don’t ride others’ [coattails]. I don’t care that UCLA had a longer tradition of academic excellence over [USC], because this will reverse with time, and trend has already begun. We actually have the means to acquire the top researchers and professors, because we can offer them what they’re worth, unlike your public institution (that greatly emphasizes far-left Socialist ideals) in trying to make them “altruistic scholars” who donate their good will to your lame institution. No, your administration has got it wrong—we live in a [Capitalist society]—and they (your researchers and professors) want to get paid what they’re worth. This is why there is a mass exodus of UCLA and Berkeley’s faculty. I hope you [Bruins] enjoy reminiscing about the “good ol’ days” of when UCLA was academically and on occasion athletically superior to USC. 
	
	Some of you make claims that UCLA students got accepted to USC as well huh? But why is it that a lot of international students, who got accepted to both, chose USC over UCLA? They get no [financial aid], and they have to pay several thousand dollars more per year as a USC student. I thought it was foolish to spend more on an academically inferior school? And what about that [bonehead] who wrote a definition of USC, claiming to have audited a class at USC, but said that it was “community college” level? I thought UCLA students were smarter than to spend $4,000+ on our “community college” classes? And if you did actually take it, why'd you [audit] it? What, was the curve too [lofty] for you? You didn't take it, and that was a lame attempt at labeling our academics "community college" level. 
	
	You guys aren’t some “quasi-Ivy League” like some of you [meatheads] imply. The UC system is nowhere near Ivy Leagues, just in its shadows at best.  
	
	Finally, look at all the negative energy UCLA students muster up to [deride] USC on this site. What a bunch of pathetic, small-minded people who know that their [luster] is dulled by us [Trojans]. 
	
		Example: [UCLA student] #1: Dude, did you see that Ferrari rolling through here to get to the multimillion dollar neighborhoods that surround our campus?
		
		UCLA student #2: Yeah, it had [USC] [alumni] plates attached to it! Next thing you know, they'll tear down our campus so that a runway can be built for the Gulstream jets that USC alumni will ride in. I wonder if they make big enough alumni plates to those as well?

	(2006-12-03 +60/-91)
	Unranked [Pac-10] team that ruined formerly #2 [USC's] chance for the [BCS] title game in 2006.
		Example: It sucks to be a [UCLA student], especially during the week your school plays [USC] in football... unless it is the week of [December 2], 2006 and USC ran home with their tail between their legs.

	(2006-08-25 +60/-187)
	actually [dumbasses], ucla is [27] now, and [usc] is 26...
	
		Example: "I go to UCLA, we think we're better than USC solely because we aren't in central and our classes are 'sweet' "
		
		"I got to USC and we shirts with a picture of [Tommy trojan] buttfucking a [Bruin], [suck on that]."

	(2004-12-02 +39/-386)
	Acronym: "University Closest to the [Lombard] Area."  Refers to [College of DuPage], a suburban Chicago Community College. The school resides in the city of [Glen Ellyn], and happens to be close to the town of Lombard.
		Example: Where you goin' to school at?  I'm goin ta [UCLA]! Whoa! Allaway out in [Cali]!? No man, in [Glen Ellyn].

	(2005-09-03 +625/-242)
	A school with above-average academics in [addition] to their [fine] [athletics].

	a drinking school with [a basketball] problem
	
	right in the middle of [farm] country, there's nothing to do, so we [play ball] and get wasted
		Example: we got two 30 packs, a bottle of bacardi dark, a bottle of [jim beam], some [absolut], a 1/4 oz of the chronic and 1.5 grams of blow and some blunts, and yeah, that was my [spring weekend]

	(2010-03-01 +201/-133)
	Notice that most if not all of these definitions associate [UConn] with drinking and basketball. Well for those of you who don't go to this school I want to give a [better view].
	
	UConn is the University of Connecticut. Its main campus is located in [Storrs], CT. It is, in fact, one of the greatest schools of this nation, as you will find it in the Top 100 Universities list of many critics and websites. The University has outstanding Schools of Business, Engineering, [Pharmacy], [Nursing], and Medicine among others.
	
	Student life here is just what others mentioned - partying. The University is located in a town that wouldn't be known at all if it wasn't for the university. Surrounded by trees and [farmland], isolated from the rest of the world, the students sort of have to spend their weekends on campus getting drugged and wasted for fun. It's a pity, really, because after a while it gets boring and to cure that boredom you abuse yourself even more.
	
	Students at this campus are very [big on] watching basketball and are fans of their [Huskies], some more than others.
	
	The University has the biggest university newspaper in the entire (small) state - The Daily Campus.
		Example: Person1: What are you doing this weekend?
		Person2: What I do every weekend. If we don't throw up in [celeron], carriage, hilltops, teds, sgt [peps] and our dorms then i'll call it a disappointing night.
		Person1: Yeah and we'll sleep next to the toilet. It's gonna be AWESOME!!!! GO [UCONN]!!!

	The greatest basketball school in the country that produced players such as Diana [Taurasi], Sue Bird, Swin Cash, [Nykesha] Sales, Rip Hamilton, [Emeka Okafor], and Ben Gordan.
		Example: [I'm good], but [I'm not] [Uconn] good?

	(2008-02-22 +209/-143)
	The largest public [university] (and primier [party school]) of [New England].
		Example: You know you go to UConn if...
		
		1. You live in [Storrs] CT at all
		2. You walk miles to get to football games
		3. You can fill all the spots in a 10-person drinking waterfall and still go to [8 AM] classes the next morning
		4. You hate [Northeastern University] for taking the husky as their official mascot first 
		5. A tent is your dorm room during basketball season

	(2005-01-03 +453/-367)
	Better than you, asshole; 2004 Men's Basketball Champions, 2004 [Women's Basketball] Champions, and 2004 [Motor City] Bowl Champions; [Toledo's] daddy; where the best athletes learn; University of Connecticut
		Example: Duke is [nowhere near] as good as [UConn]. UConn is the greatest sports team in the world! [Toledo] got killed by UConn, 39-10.

	(2010-11-01 +19/-5)
	An exceptionally elite group of gentlemen, who, on weekends [forego] there scholarly paths to beat the ever [living shit] out of each other, get obscenly dirty, then drink till you can't stand while laughing with the guy you were previously beating.

uconn spring weekend
	(2007-02-06 +78/-13)
	The weekend everyone at [UConn] looks forward to.  Some weekend in [April], everyone at UConn and anyone who knows anybody at UConn comes together to drink a lot, cause a lot of trouble, and just have fun.
	
	Thursday night- carraige apts
	Friday night- [celeron] apts
	Saturday night- x-lot
	
	X-lot is a huge parking lot where thousands of kids pack into and just have a giant party.
		Example: 1.[UConn Spring Weekend] this year only had 150 [duis], 50 assaults, 100 drug possesions, 454564545 parking tickets, and 2 flipped cars.  I'd say it was a pretty tame [spring weekend]!

ucra
	(2006-05-17 +92/-38)
	A corruption of "[ucla]", due to a heavy [east asian] accent.  This pronunciation is used commonly in the local dialect of [Westwood], where over 40% of students at said institution are in fact of east asian ancestry.
		Example: We should probably put "Fucra" on our [shirts] so that they understand what we are talking about.

UCR
	(2011-04-08 +420/-50)
	[University of California, Redemption]. In an era where public education in the State of California is taking hits in K-12, CCs, the CSUs, and the UC system, many of the State's public universities have been forced to cut their enrollments through more intense admissions standards. Hence, these schools accept less freshman and transfer students. However, with schools like UC Riverside, [UC Santa Cruz] and even [UC Merced] (where previous reputation has been less than stellar among college admissions-hype beasts and GPA/SAT/ACT-obsessed high school seniors too caught up with the TOP 50 of the USNWR), the rise in demand, popularity, as well as increased competition of quality applicants, has helped ALL the UCs get on the fast-track towards increased prestige and improved rep with more selective applicant pools, and, in the long-term, more prepared and exceptionally qualified freshman and transfer students. UCR is definitely on this track and is truly rising. Therefore, UCR should be considered less as "UC Rejects" and more, the [University of California, REDEMPTION].
		Example: Fuck yeah, it ain't nothing to be ashamed of getting into and going to [UC] Riverside! Consider yourself [REDEEMED]! UCR = UC REDEMPTION. Go out there and get your education! [Fuck the haters], UCR is a UC school for a reason!

	(2006-07-19 +184/-327)
	[University of California, Riverside].  Called "UC-Rejected" by students who think that the other [UC's] are [superior].
		Example: Man, [I can't] believe [I didn't] even [get into] UCR.

	(2008-07-30 +124/-277)
	The University of California, [Riverside] (UCR) is one of the least prestigious schools within the prestigious [UC] system.    As one of only two [UCs] with a [business school] it should in theory attract a large number of [serious business] students.  In reality, the business degree acts as a [catch-all] for students who would otherwise be "undeclared" and/or those students who have no interest in business aside from "making my [millionz]".  
	
	Riverside itself is seedy and dangerous.  I know only a very small handful of people who were not robbed at least once while living there...I was not one of those fortunate few.  [Crack whores] (in the strictly literal sense) "work" up and down University Ave. less than [half a mile] from the campus.  My own work as a [pizza delivery] driver exposed me and my co-workers to the ever present danger of [armed robbery], gun-violence and gang-activity.  That said, with the right perspective, this place offers a valuable opportunity for much of its student body to experience the "real world" in graduated steps, should they choose to do so.  I can say from my own experience that it has had an incredible "[humanizing]" affect on my perception of the homeless and others living in horrible situations.
	
	While the student body is largely apathetic (there is no school spirit as has been mentioned above but no one has bothered to ask whether or not school spirit is an admirable goal or merely a herd-mentality annoyance) there are plenty of very serious students and instructors.  Several people have claimed that many instructors cannot speak English.  A colleague of mine who is a Sociology [lecturer] of Chinese descent at UCR often finds that "cannot speak English" is on his student feedback forms despite the fact that he was born in New York, has spent his entire life in the US and speaks flawless English with no accent.  I would also contest the notion that students graduating from UCR are bound to mediocrity.  I am a graduate from UCR (if I have not already made that plainly obvious) who is currently pursuing his PhD at [King's] College, London on a full-ride scholarship.  
	
	My reason for writing this very loose "definition" is to, hopefully, spread a much more balanced assessment of UCR both as an institution of higher learning as well as a social environment for students.  It may not be a great school for parties, but that was never my scene so I couldn't really comment much on that.  There are some students who [immerse] themselves in the community and who generally find whatever it is that they're looking for.  There is another class of students who race home every weekend and who treat their time at UCR as an extension of high school.  Like anything else, a student can expect to get out of their time at UCR exactly what they put in.  I know I got a whole helluva lot, and I’m sure many others have as well.    
	 
		Example: UCR, while not the most [prestigious] of [UCs], is considered fairly prestigious overseas as it is only known as "part of the [UC] system"

	(2010-08-19 +64/-251)
	UCR - Also known as University of Rejects or University of [Riverside].
	
	A [UC] that everyone goes to because they didn't make it into any other [UCs]. Usually a backup school for people who want flaunt that they are in a UC. UCR has the lowest expectations out of all the University. Pretty pathetic how it can even be called a UC.
		Example: Guy: You're going to a [CSU]? [Hah] I'm going to a UCR sucker!
		Girl: You mean University of [Rejects]?

	(2005-04-25 +47/-291)
	Otherwise known as the University of California, [Riverside]; or the "last resort" [UC]. Many who go there are said to have had no other school options-- which is not quite true for ALL students [per se], but close to factual for a large chunk of the attending. 
	[Dorms] are inhabited by mostly freshmen as second+ years run away from campus to apartments. Many go home for the weekend because the student body are "goddamn" "penises" and don't make better the situation they're in.
	
	A UCR party will consist of:
	1. Alcohol
	2. Alcohol
	3. Standing
	4. A little music
	5. People throwing up
	The concept of "Drinking Game" seems to [allude] these students.
	
	Notes about the campus:
	During winter, the campus is actually fairly green *gasp*
		Example: [Georgetown] U Student: Hello
		[UCR] sTuNdenT1: WHACHO GOT?
		Georgetown U Student: Excuse me?
		[uCr] SitUndiEnt2: YOUR MOM [BIZOTCH]
		
		Other UCR Student: I talk to walls because I don't want to deal with shit like 1 and 2.

	(2011-02-24 +132/-26)
	A school located in [Riverside], California. Apart of the [UC] system and has amazing professors, facilities, and programs. Catches a bad rep for having low admissions standards in the past. Known for it's commitment to [underserved], disadvantaged communities and having a diverse student population. A school improving in reputation in all facets of education. Shit on by insecure people.
		Example: The Washington Monthly ranked [UCR] 16th in the United States in terms of social mobility, research and community service, while [US News and World Report] ranked [UCR's] undergraduate program 94th in the nation (out of 368 colleges) based on peer assessment, student selectivity, financial resources, and other factors. U.S. News ranks UCR as the third most ethnically diverse and, by the number of undergraduates receiving [Pell] Grants (42 percent), the 15th most economically diverse student body in the nation. UCR's extensive outreach and retention programs have contributed to its reputation as a "campus of choice" for minority students, including LGBT students. In 2005, UCR became the first public university campus in the nation to offer a gender-neutral housing option.

	(2004-08-27 +743/-226)
	a [pretty nice] place, [friendly] people, nice [atmosphere]. good academics
		Example: east lothian, diverse [student body], [bourne] [engineering] building

	(2006-09-23 +485/-234)
	A rising UC with growing engineering and bio programs. recently has been ranked among the top 25 universities to attend in the nation. Is currently in the process of building their own medical school.
	This UC also boasts the #1 [entomology] program in the nation. not bad for being called the former [bottom feeder] uc. [UC Santa Cruz], Santa Barbara and Irvine have recently dropped status according to Newsweek
	
		Example: [I go] to ucr which used to be bad, but now we're [better than] [uci] so life is good.

	(2003-11-07 +112/-354)
	a college designed with the sole intent of destroying all your ideals regarding college. It's not a magical land of [mature people], it's a fantasy land where perpetual high school kids live independently from their parents for four years. It's inhabited with a mixed batch of pituitary cases and shallow cellphone [brandishing] moroons who have no interest in learning. The eclectic interest of the typical student at [UCR] lies in the following activities: never attending classes, failing nearly everything, drinking themselves retarded, gaining base knowledge on how to unreflectively acquire a decent paying job in order to attain some materialistic goal bred from a californian upbringing, and if they get lucky, turning impressionable freshman girls into emotional wrecks.
		Example: Speaking of [vacuous], [i go] to [UCR].

	(2005-04-22 +89/-324)
	College which is apparently filled with [whiny] losers who do not understand that education is [what you make of it].  Students continuously cry about how they [did not make it] into a "better" school instead of doing something about it.  The students make the school, lack of intelligence, motivation, and direction comes from students, not the school itself.
		Example: Waa [waaa] [waaaaa] I go to [UCR] and I don't feel smart, waaa waaaa - whiney UCR student with no potential.

ucsb boy
	(2007-11-13 +76/-56)
	UCSB Boys are slovenly booze hounds who never study. They are always either high or drunk. In between surfing and drinking, they smoke weed and enjoy casual, drunken sex with any willing participants (including animals and other men). They can frequently be seen [playing frisbee] shirtless, skateboarding or riding their [beach cruisers] while innocently licking ice cream cones obtained at the [DLG]. They are also against "fat beezies."
		Example: [UCSB boy] #1: [Duude]...I wannaa hit that Monkey
		
		UCSB boy #2: Duude...you are totes wearing beer goggles- that is one [fat beezy]

UCSB
	(2004-07-23 +1558/-321)
	1. University of California - [Santa Barbara]
	
	2. [University of Casual Sex and Beer]
	
	3. An almost too-good-to-be-true place that combines excellent academics with a [vibrant] social atmosphere and perfect weather. It is also the only university in the United States that owns its own beach.
		Example: [Omigod] [you go] to UCSB? [Can I] be your friend?

	(2008-01-27 +471/-144)
	Classically known as the University of Casual Sex and Beer, but also known as:

	-U Can [Smoke Bud]
	
	-Underage Californians Studying Booze
	
	-University of California's Sunny Beaches

		Example: UCSB also somehow manages to match this reputation in academic superiority, having [top-notch] professors and [world renowned]  research [facilities].  

	(2005-02-13 +622/-243)
	[UC] Santa Barbara-a collection of students that are drunk more days than not and have mastered the skill of studying [buzzed], going to class buzzed and passing [midterms] buzzed.
		Example: Non SB-er: You go to UCSB? Is it [true that] 12% of the students have STDs?
		[SB] student: I dont know...does it look like I take fucking a [poll] about that shit?

	An acronym for University of Cunts and [Sons of Bitches].  An institute for higher learning and research, located in [Santa Barbara], California, is known for its student body with a high fraction of [trust fund] babies from Los Angeles and the surrounding regions.
		Example: Kate: Can't believe Jasmine is gonna go to UCSB!  Now she'll [dye] her hair blond and gets boobs and stuff being around all those whores!
		
		[Erika]: No way, she'll be [hungin] around with Latinas with huge bellies...

	(2009-05-15 +66/-500)
	The University of California, Santa Barbara.
	
	Ranked 44th by US News and World Report. The school has had five faculty win the Nobel Prize, 27 have been elected to the National Academy of the Sciences, 27 to the National Academy of Engineering, and 23 to the [American Academy] of the Arts and Sciences.
	
	It is located in Santa Barbara, California, on a small peninsula or isle that the University owns.
	
	The school is known for a few things:
	
	1.) Despite its reputation, it is not academically virtuous.
	2.) It houses the most incredible and drunken parties to take place at any University in the US. (Possibly world)
	3.) Many people that attend UCSB are bitter that they got rejected [to East coast] schools, and top tier [UC's].
	4.) Most other colleges in Southern California drive to UCSB to rage.
	5.) There is no competition at UCSB because everyone is drunk 100% of the time.
	6.) UCSB is a great school is you want a college experience like no other.
		Example: Friend 1: I go to UCSB because I got rejected to Cal and [UCLA] :(
		Friend 2: ME TOO!
		Friend 1: Let's go Party on Isle Vista because our we will graduate no matter what.
		
		High School Student: Where did you go to college?!
		High School Teacher: I went to UCSB, that's why I'm a high school teacher :)
		
		[USC] [undergrad]: I'm bored in LA.
		UCLA undergrad: Even though I hate you, I agree, let's go rage at UCSB?

	(2003-03-12 +1100/-319)
	The best [fucking] [school] in [the world]
		Example:

UCSD
	(2004-09-25 +1172/-372)
	A school with no [football team], but exercises that [pride] with the following [t-shirt], i.e.
		Example: UCSD [Triton] [Football]: Still [Undefeated]!

	(2005-09-30 +1230/-645)
	University of California, San Diego. A top-tier public institution in [La Jolla], California. Academic strengths include the sciences, engineering, economics, and [political science]. Second in the UC system only to [UC Berkeley]. Wastes no money on bloated sports system unlike UCLA. 
		Example: I wish i had gone to UCSD because [UCLA] sucks at [everything but] [football].

	(2007-04-13 +410/-218)
	UCSD is the only school besides Berkeley, UCLA, and [UCI] where the hard-working middle-class asian is the majority. As a result, UCSD has a large mass of workahalics who lack adequate americanized social skills despite knowing how to [ace a test]. But, the university still boasts the best weather and location in the country, and has 20,000 [undergrads] to select one's group of friends from. In response, it may not be [party central], but if you go to UCSD and don't have fun or find someone attractive... it is likely becuase you are one of the individuals giving the university a bad name by being antisocial and looking like a nerd.. UCSD is what you make it. Overall, it's cheap, a good college experience for those who actually try to make it one, a place that students actually want to get a degree from. And, if you just want to party all of the time and work ar Burger King once you graduate, [SDSU] is right down the street. 
		Example: [200] [Daniel Lee's] currently [attend] UCSD

	(2007-05-09 +396/-216)
	Good school in beautiful [La Jolla]. Doing well at UCSD is easy because La Jolla is NOT a [party town].  People who think they are smart, Asians, and prematurely balding men are found in abundance at UCSD. There is a serious shortage of naturally beautiful girls, and even less guys with game. Students looking to have fun turn to liquor,ganja, or other drugs, which are generally easy to come by. Looking to get laid- Mexico is only a short drive away. Whatever UCSD lacks in the social scene they attempt to make up in free concert points; where three times a year popular music artists preform at [Rimac]. Downside to this is that most UCSD students don't know what the hell to do at a concert.
	  Like most things, UCSD is [what you make of it]. If you put in a little more effort and have access to a car, you can have fun and get a great education at the same time.  
		Example: "Dude you live in San Diego why are you so pale?"
		" I go to UCSD."
		" At UCSD I partied my ass off and still graduated in four years."
		"I thought everyone at UCSD were pansy-ass nerds from suburbia, but I met some chill people smoking out on the [cliffs]."
		"I saw my professor naked on [the far side] of [Blacks Beach]." 

	(2009-04-08 +137/-97)
	[10] guys + 2 [cupcakes] + 1 [dorm room] = UCSD Party!
		Example: I hear Jerrberr [baked] some [cupcakes], looks like there's gonna be a UCSD [party] tonight!

	(2005-05-05 +770/-644)
	A school without attractive people.  After attending this [school one] will be diagnosed with the [Triton Eye].  The Triton Eye is a disease caused by being around ugly girls too long and your standards for what is attractive is [lowered] extremely.
		Example: An example of the [Triton Eye] would be looking at a girl and thinking I would [have sex] with her (but [dear God] you know you dont want to).

	(2008-05-11 +180/-173)
	[University] of [California] of the [Socially Dead]
		Example: Where do you [go to school]? I go to UCSD. Oh I'm sorry dude, you go to [University] of California of the [Socially Dead], that sucks.

	(2007-05-26 +294/-296)
	A place for those who were [rejected] from [UCB]/[UCLA].
		Example: I was rejected from [Cal] and [UCLA], but I was accepted into UCSD.  [Oh well].

	(2007-09-18 +263/-276)
	UCSD from the transfer student point of view. If you go here as a transfer student (if you are a Californian) you did not get in to UCLA or [UCB]. You are very bitter over this fact and walk around mad at the world. Every time you drive down [Sunset Blvd]. past UCLA you get a tear in your eye.
	
	You wish there was affirmative action for Caucasian girls. You are in shock when you go to [SDSU] and see all those cute girls.
		Example: You have a sandwich at Subway, and realize all the girls are nerdy Asian types.
		
		You hate walking uphill by the library.
		
		One more crappy weekend hanging out at crappy [Gaslamp] clubs.
		
		You pray you get into [UCB] or UCLA for [grad school].
		
		Other people always know UCSD was you third choice. 

	(2006-07-03 +320/-362)
	A [pompous], self-promoting institution located in [La Jolla], CA.  Considers itself [a big deal], but really isn't anything special.  Also pretends to be in San Diego to hide the fact that it's incredibly boring and devoid of attractive females.
		Example: You're [going] to UCSD?  [Haha], you're going to get the [Triton Eye]!

ucsc
	(2005-05-31 +628/-241)
	An area where [trees] are the only things [you will see] more than [white people].
		Example: is that ucsc [over there]?

	(2007-09-20 +164/-63)
	-A [breathtakingly beautiful] campus, home of the [Banana Slugs].
	
	-School some of the best programs in the country like [astronomy] and psychology. Great tennis and swim teams without a hyper inflated sports budget. Offers courses called History of The Beatles, and History of Bob Dylan.
	
	-Not comprised entirely of hipsters, hippies, and stoners. Whatever stereotype you are identified as/identify with is most likely represented also. 
		Example: Angry Local: Brah! You can't surf here, uck-suck kid!
		
		[UCSC] Student: Dude, we represent, like, 25% of [the SC] economy, so piss off and [get a job]!

	(2009-01-01 +82/-211)
	A hellhole posing as a university. Unless you're already broke, it takes [shitloads] of your/your parent's money and gives you shit in return. Useless protests often [drown out] the professors, who would prefer to talk about their last vacation rather than the appropriate subject anyway. 
	
	The only way to make friends is to smoke pot and have the same five minutes of discussion (dude, where u from? o no [weyy]! i'm from this place 300 miles from ther!!) over and over and fucking over, or to go on protests discouraging the use of shampoo and/or conditioner. The stink of B.O. and pot is commonly accepted and follows 95% of the students around campus, to classes, the dining hall, etc. Anyone who chooses to clean themselves and flush their piss and shit down down the throne is [chastised] for being "privileged". The dining hall is filthy as [a rat's ass], and dishes are rarely washed. But not to worry; vegan options are always available in excess! Every female on campus has taken several severe beatings with [the ugly stick], it's no wonder the males have a reputation for being gay. 
	
	If you are considering going here, I highly discourage it, unless you find my description tantalizing. I went in with an open mind and have regretted it every single day.
		Example: On [June 12], [2009], I will never have to see the hell known as [UCSC] again in my life.

	(2005-07-06 +272/-127)
	Wow. Needless to say, I think it's the only campus in North America where "History of Conciousness" is an accepted major. Also, if you go to UCSC, and haven't done [First Rain] at least once, you're just [faking the funk]. Also, the best college book ever, "Don't Tell the Parents" was written by the [proctor] of my old dorm, and is highly suggested reading to all interested in the campus.
		Example: UCSC: Where [the forest] [animals] are [protected] more than the students.

	(2005-08-19 +192/-88)
	University of California at [Santa Cruz]
	
	A beautiful campus where people are generally great, you get around on [public transportation] or biking, you learn to think for yourself b/c some of the professors are completely off their rocker, and you work hard not to get pegged as "[bleeding-heart liberal]," "wigger," "AzN," "token angry black person," "fascist conservative," "that immigrant kid that can't speak English," or "rich emo kid."
		Example: UCSC has the [coolest] [mascot] ever - GO [SLUGS]!

	(2007-03-10 +90/-43)
	[University] of Collegians [Smoking] [Chronic]
	
	 
		Example: 1. 1156 [High Street]
		
		2. "How do you like UCSC?"
		   
		   "[I don't remember]."
		
		3. Even the weirdo [Merrill] kids smoke herb

	(2005-03-23 +207/-112)
	people don't just walk around naked here. Deer walk around naked too.
	this is also a good place to get brainwashed from the [FAR left], walk around in the woods, learn to like the way pot smells, learn to take public transportation,[evaluate] everything, and most [improtantly] learn how to live compleatly seperated from anything you might need or want, like a best buy or an In and Out.
		Example: [ted] is doing really great at UCSC his perfomance in "how to be part of the world:[injustice] and [america]" was evaluated as "moderatly successful".

	(2012-05-03 +55/-25)
	University of California, Santa Cruz
	
	This amazing university is sadly and extremely underrated.
	
	UCSC definitely has higher prestige than [UC Merced] and UC Riverside, and UCSC is quickly becoming more prestigious and selective. UCSC is ranked equally if not better than UCSB.

UDIABD
	(2013-05-02 +419/-9)
	Acronym for Urban Dictionary is a [Big Dummy]. Less vulgar version of [UDIAFA], likely to be spoken by very young people or by people not prone to profanity. (see UDIAFA)
	
	UDIABD is ascribed to the lame-butt [Urban Dictionary website] by people who have been able to easily submit definitions in the past but for reasons that are never explained, are unable to post a particular definition. This is particularly frustrating when the Urban Dictionary user has had a number of pathetic, senseless or meaningless terms accepted before, but tries 10-15 times to have another term accepted and is unsuccessful, though the term is no more inane than the ones he has had accepted without hassle in the past, and no reason is given by the dumb website (UDIABD) why the term has not been accepted.
		Example: An Urban Dictionary user tries to post the term:
		
		[SHERBET] [YODI]
		
		Nickname of Mike Ass.
		
		Known as [Sherbet] [Yodi], a late-grade-school- or young-middle-school-aged boy named Mike Ass who developed the nickname because his favorite ice cream was [sherbet] and his favorite Star Wars character was [Yoda]. As his friends insisted that sherbet was not real ice cream and said that Yoda was a dork, they began to mockingly call him Sherbet Yodi, and his nickname was [solidified]. Exhausted after some time of enduring the ridiculing moniker, Mike Ass (aka Sherbet Yodi) kicked one of the gang of friends in the groin and insisted they refer to him by his birth name. This, at least to a notable degree, worked; from that point forward he was primarily addressed and referred to by his real name. In the end, ironically, the boy, contemplating his given name, decided he preferred Sherbet Yodi.
		
		Example: "Ya know, Sherbet [Yodi's] real name is Mike Ass."
		
		tags: Mike Ass, Yoda, sherbet, nut-kick, Comtpon
		
		... but the definition is never accepted, and no reasons are given by the website (UDIABD) why it's been rejected.

	A person who "reinvents the wheel" by posting non-slang, Wikipedia-like (or Dictionary.com) definitions to Urban Dictionary. Come on sheeple, awaken and [get a clue]!
	
	Urban Dictionary is supposed to be a place where slang, coined words, ghetto slang (ebonics), [teenspeak], regional colloquialisms and other neologisms are defined for the benefit of others (preferably with some wit and humor).
	
	Abbreviations and acronyms of non-slang words/terms are also acceptable as long as they are briefly defined (and don't then morph into an [encyclopedic] reference).
		Example: Contrasting examples:
		
		MISOGYNIST (UDtard definition): A woman hater.
		
		MISOGYNIST (slang definition): A man who wins an argument with a feminist.
		
		>>>>>>>>
		
		RACIST (UDtard definition): Someone who feels racially superior, and exercises prejudice or negative attitudes towards people of a different skin color.
		
		RACIST (slang definition): A statement of surrender during an argument.
		
		When two people are engaged in an [acrimonious] debate, the one that first says "Racist!" has [conceded] defeat. Synonymous with saying "Resign" during a chess game.
		
		"Racist" acquired this new meaning when debaters (predictably) used the term as an argument of last resort. (They couldn't prevail against logic, truth, and common sense, so they played the race card to try and eek out a victory).
		
		>>>>>>>>
		
		CLOWN (UDtard definition): a circus performer known for their comic antics, exaggerated physical features, brightly colored costumes, and heavy use of stage make-up.
		
		CLOWN (slang definitions): 1. A person who is humorous without intention, therefore is a dumb mutha.
		
		2. A girl who covers herself in so much makeup, the true flesh of her face is difficult or impossible to see.
		
		>>>>>>>>

UGANDAN KNUCKLES
	(2018-01-09 +381/-46)
	“Ugandan Knuckles” has its origins in a nearly year-old joke, but thanks to an easily downloadable character model and the explosive world of VRChat, [the problematic] meme has been quickly spreading.
	
	Ugandan Knuckles didn’t start out as the Ugandan Knuckles meme; the character is inspired by a goofy caricature of the [echidna], who first made his appearance in Sonic the Hedgehog 3. The weird version of Knuckles made his debut in a Sonic Lost World video review from Gregzilla, a popular YouTuber with more than 120,000 subscribers. Other YouTubers latched on to the character and started to create “Knuckles Sings” videos, a series of memes in which the deformed Knuckles sang a variety of songs, like Smash Mouth’s “All Star.”
	
	It wasn’t until September 2017 that a 3D model of the deformed echidna entered the world, giving birth to memesters everywhere. Still, it would be another three months before players of VRChat — a Second Life-esque world that lets [Oculus Rift] and [HTC Vive] owners inhabit 3D models and interact with others in a variety of settings — latched on to the model, downloading it in hordes and inserting hundreds of strange Knuckles into the game. Using inspiration from the movie [Who Killed Captain Alex], the meme was born. Some phrases a lot of people use include: 'YOU DO NOT KNOW THE WAY!' , 'WHY R U RUNNING?!' , 'THE QUEEN, WHERE HAS SHE GONE!!' , '*clicking noises*' ,
		Example: [idk], dont ask me how to [use it] in a sentence! [figure it out] yourself u UGANDAN KNUCKLES

Many behaviors practiced by "[ugly americans]" are simply innocent mistakes involving actions that are perfectly acceptable in America, but are shunned in foreign countries. Some universal symptoms of an ugly american is excessive amounts of luggage, overly casual clothes, etc. However, others vary from country to country. For example, in France, you will get your ass kicked if you refer to fries as "freedom fries". They're french fries over there, and they're eaten with a fork. To them, this signifies an overly patriotic American with no respect for other cultures. A far easier mistake to make is, in Australia, the peace/victory sign made by sticking out two middle fingers is the equivalent to saying "[up yours]" if the palm is facing the person it's directed at.
		Example: I could go on and on and on about the different symptoms of [Ugly American]. My advice to all Americans: [Thoroughly] research a country before [visiting] it.

	An animated show about The Department of Integration, in both a fictional government agency and version of New York City. The show focuses on Mark Lilly, a new employee at said department, and also often shows his alcoholic wizard work partner Leonard Powers, his zombie roommate Randall Skeffington, and his demon girlfriend Callie Maggotbone (voiced by the incredibly hot Natasha Leggero). Its pointless as hell, has characters you would kill if you had to deal with them on a daily basis, and the fact the show will never establish a plot that makes sense (which isn't saying it doesn't maintain one, its just [too crazy] to understand). Its like The Office... its so unrealistic its hilarious.
	
	The show has legendary quotes such as: "[SUCK MY BALLS]", "I really wanna see these trees fuck" (fuck being [bleeped] on U.S. Television), and an episode where Councilman [Fitzpatrick], a [Fishman], not only bangs hookers while campaigning to become The Mayor of New York City, but also jumps out of a helicopter for his big rally and is chopped to pieces by the [rotor] blades.
		Example: In the pilot episode of Ugly Americans: [The Birdman] flew over the building and crapped on Mark's head, when complaining to [the Birdman], the Birdman simply replied "[SUCK MY BALLS]!".

ugly cry
	(2007-08-27 +8124/-2291)
	A type of crying that can feel really good and really bad at the same time.  [The ugly cry] can occur after a severe tragedy in one's life, or simply for no reason at all. You know you're doing [the ugly cry] when you lose COMPLETE CONTROL of all of the muscles in your face, start heaving and making awkward sounds (even though you are trying really hard to be silent), and start leaking fluids from every opening on your face from your hairline to your chin (yes, this includes the mouth). Without a doubt, by the time you are through with your ugly cry episode (if it was genuine) it will look as though you are a homeless person with pink eye who got punched a few times in the face and was hit my a [monsoon]; this is completely normal (and generally the time to call up a good friend).
		Example: [Johnny's mom] just died, and when he tried to tell me about her, he broke into [the ugly cry] instead.

	The ugly cry is truly ugly. If you look in the mirror while doing [the ugly cry] you're bound to stop crying. Unless, of course, you don't like the way you look and then that could make you go into a further tortured, ugly cry.
		Example: [Babette] and Stud pass a [rusted] out VW on the highway.
		
		Babette: Holy shit! Did you see that guy?
		Stud: Yup. [Ugly cry].
		Babette: Poor guy...

	(2010-01-27 +28/-5)
	[The ugly cry] is the kind of thing actors and actresses train for years to defeat. It involves your eyes getting puffy, red and bloodshot, your nose running off your face, your skin getting [blotchy] and red, and your facial features [bunching] up rather unattractively.
		Example: Girl 1: Oh God, [who died]?
		
		Girl 2: What do you mean?

UK
	(2010-03-03 +551/-255)
	UK is short for the [United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]. The UK is a country consisting of different parts that used to be seperate countries. Some people count these as still being different countries because some laws are different (and also a few people just think 'they have different names so they're different countries') The UK has one currency, one government, and one 'normal' language (the majority of people don't [speak Welsh], Scots, Gaelic, or anything, and those who do all speak English as well). The UK is a part of the continent Europe. Some people talk about 'Europe' as if the UK isn't part of it. What they actually mean is mainland Europe.
	
	(In alphabetical order because we shouldn't assume any parts are more important than others)
	In the British Isles:
	England
	Northern Ireland
	[Republic of Ireland]
	Scotland
	Wales
	some other little islands
	
	Great Britain (shortened to Britain):
	England
	Scotland
	Wales
	maybe some of the little islands?
	
	United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK):
	England
	Northern Ireland
	Scotland
	Wales
	probably some of the little islands
		Example: UK, United Kingdom, and [United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland] are all interchangable. Britain and Great Britain are interchangable. The [Republic of Ireland] and ROI are interchangable. Ireland is as well but can also be used to mean the piece of land containing Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Apart from these, all the other words mean different things. UK, Britain, and England do NOT mean the same thing.
		
		There should not be a stereotype for British or English people or people from the UK (come to think of it, there shouldn't be any stereotypes at all anywhere).
		
		*People from the UK are not all posh.
		*Like in any country, there are lots of different accents. So if you hear weird accents on TV, don't assume that's how everone sounds.
		*Not everyone likes tea.
		*Not everyone likes the Royal family.
		*Some people like Americans, some hate them, and some really don't care.
		*Most young people find the idea of eating oatmeal soaked in blood ([black pudding]) completely disgusting.
		*There are some Scottish people out there who think eating yucky bits of sheep (haggis) is disgusting.
		*Not everyone likes football. Football is the same as soccer is in America, and rugby is either the same as or just a similar idea to American Football (because originally there was AsSOCCiation FOOTBALL, and RUGBY FOOTBALL. We just chose to shorten them in different ways.)
		
		I'm not going to list everything, because I can't be bothered, and anyway you get the picture.

	(2021-04-20 +32/-10)
	A place where crack is [smoked] under a [bridge] and the [police] are famously shit.
		Example: "You get'n [th] [wa'er] from th UK?"

	(2010-04-22 +1273/-974)
	A fantastic country that once ruled the world (yes, literally) and is much cooler than the USA because it is older and cleaner. Also has amazing music such as Muse and Radiohead and [Biffy Clyro] and Arctic Monkeys and Mumford and Sons and [Marina and the Diamonds] and [Florence and the Machine] and so much more. However, none of this amazing music ever gets in the charts for long because music charts have been hijacked by chavs and their fake RnB which actually is badly disguised pop (see JLS). However, amazing venues still exist across the UK, the best including the Hammersmith Apollo, the Brixton Acadamy, The O2 Arena and many, many more. Even Wembley Arena has its merits, despite their 'confiscating staplers at Arctic Monkeys concerts' policy and the fact that I was hit on the head by a condom-balloon there.
	
	Also very prevalent in the UK is clever people. Many students learn Latin and are teased mercilessly about it and amazingly avoid being 'binned' by jealous chavs.
		Example: The UK is [incredible], and should be worshipped by all [those people] in [the USA] who think they're bigger than us.

	(2007-01-17 +366/-442)
	wow, [looky], we invented [the english language], [fancy that].
		Example: uk aint all that bad, we just invented tv, phones, actually at one point we owned much of the world, [no really].no figuratively, [litterally].
		
		come to [think of it]. we did a lot more that some.

	(2005-12-29 +631/-843)
	It is really pathetic that so many Americans have written definitions for the UK,England etc when they don't even live here and most of them have never even been here. They use urban dictionary to argue the point that they are not stupid, fat, opionated liars etc then they say things like this 'An island of crumpet eating tea sucking whiny bastards who are jealous of the USA and its might'.
	
	Sure, America may be a super power now but pick up a fucking [history book], super powers [never last] forever, [like the Romans], Egyptians and even the UK which used to own about the quarter of the world. America is already the most hated country in the world so be nice to the other countries if you want us to help you need it and stop [banging on] about saving our asses in the second world war, you only got involved cause of [Pearl Harbour] and stuff and less people would have died if you'd helped at the start but this is in the past so it doesn't even matter now anyway.
	
	Anyways the UK is a group of countries and islands, the biggest  being England. It is on the same line of [latitude] as Labrador (the place not the dog) but because of the warm sea current that i forget the name of, the climate is [temperate]. It is a fairly peaceful place to live and most people don't really give a fuck.
	
	However there is an increasing epidemic of chavs which are the sub [human scum] of the earth and are diluting the otherwise okay population. People complain about immigrants but at least most of them work, and they don't try and fight you just cause you looked at them or something stupid like that.
	
	Also we do not all have bad teeth, we don't all [drink tea].. i don't even know how to make it.. and we are not all posh (far from it). For more information visit a tourist sight or something.
	
	O and for the person who was banging on about Ireland... we don't hate the Irish or anything and i'm sure most British people would give Northern Island back to Ireland but it's not our choice is it fools, also they aren't totally the victims, if you look in [old news] you will find that the IRA blew up parts of England including the centre of Manchester killing lots of people but nobody even talks about that anymore anyways and we don't hate each others guts and we go on holidays to each others countries ffs and the IRA have said they are [disarming] now anyways.  
	
	Finally we're not all posh, pompous idiots either, some of the most popular TV shows here are ones that [take the piss out of] us like [Little Britain] so yes we do have a sense of humour and we don't all love the fucking queen!
	
	Since i was born in Wales and have lived there, and now live in England and have been to Scotland many times and know people in Northern Island i think my definition is more accurate than someone from america or australia or some other far thrown place, who are fools for writing a defintion for a country they don't even know and in some cases probably couldn't even point to on a map.
		Example: [People] in the UK [don't give a fuck]

	(2003-08-23 +622/-950)
	[The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland]. A country primarily located in Western Europe, once spanning a quarter of the globe.  Having lost it's substantial land [holdings] due to two world wars and the resulting cold war between the Soviet and Western Blocs, the UK still ranks as one of the world's top 5 super-powers. In reality, second only to the United States in global influence, the United Kingdom occupies a position of prominence in the United Nations and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. While having nowhere near the present population or military might of the United States, Britain posesses an impressive society with a standard of living which [outclasses] overall (wide-scale) any nation on the planet.
		Example: [The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland] is [commonly] referred to as the UK.

	(2010-05-24 +95/-155)
	A soveriegn state, not a country. It is made up of England and Scotland (which are countries), Wales (a [principality]) and Northern Ireland (a province). Ireland doesnt exist, there are only the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. Britain is not the same thing; it's real name is Great Britain, and it's the island on which Wales, England and Scotland are found. When [King James] inherited the English crown, which already owned that of Wales, Great Britain became a monarchy, hence the british empire-not the empire of the UK. [The union jack] is not the flag of Great Britain, it is a modified version which encorporates Northern Ireland, making it the flag of the UK.
		Example: the [uk] [isnt] a fucking [country]

	(2006-08-20 +316/-610)
	The United Kingdom of Great [Britian] and Northern Ireland. Not interchangeable with England. Once had an Empire that [spanned] a quarter of the Earth, but through various circumstances lost most of it, but still remains the country with the most oversea territories. [USA's] greatest ally, yet according to the previous definitions the two countries hate eachother. Situated in Europe. Has a Prime-minister who does what ever Bush says. One of the most powerful/influentual countries in the world.
		Example: The UK totally kicked [Argentina's] arse when the [latter] invaded the [Falkland Islands].

uk garage
	(2006-12-12 +103/-22)
	[UK Garage] is a form of electronic dance music which originated in clubs at Vauxhall, south London around 1994-1996, and rapidly spread around the capital, but which actually has its roots in the original Garage sound which began in New York in the 1980s. 
	
	Originally referred to as "House & Garage" or "the Sunday Scene" (because it was difficult for promoters to find venues for the music on other weekend days at the time), the speeded-up Garage sound was eventually given the name "Speed Garage" by the media. 
	
	The original [UKG] sound had a [four to the floor] beat; however from 1997 onwards, the breakbeat-influenced "2-Step" sound became increasingly popular. Reggae, [drum 'n' bass] and hip-hop sounds, as well as R&B vocal samples, increased in influence in [uk garage] around this time.  
	
	The main difference between UK and US Garage, other than being faster, was the use of heavy sub-bass which had more in common with drum 'n' bass or reggae than traditional house or garage. 
	
	In the early years, records mainly featured vocal versions using proper singers (with additional instrumental/dub mixes), but from 1998 onwards, the use of MCs started to gain prominence, having originally been used mainly at the rave, and on pirate radio stations which were of great importance to the music's development.
	
	At the start of the new millennium, [east London's] UK Garage offshoot - grime - grew out of the increasingly MC-driven garage style, whereas [south London's] dubstep scene tended towards more minimal, dubby, instrumental tracks but with heavier bass.
		Example: The "House & Garage" days: Carl Bias & BIP - I'm Up In Heaven (1994)
		
		Early "classic 4x4 [UK Garage]" sounds: Underground Solution - You're No Good (1997)
		
		Early [2-Step] [UKG]: Ramsey & Fen - Love Bug (1998)
		
		Early UKG with MCs: Da Click - Good Rhymes (1998)
		
		Dark pre-grime Garage: So Solid Crew - Dilema (Instrumental) (2000)

UK Hardcore
	(2008-04-06 +92/-38)
	Hardcore is a genre of music that originated in the UK in the early 80's. Hardcore events, known as [Raves] took place in fields, houses, clubs and warehouses throughout the UK. The police and government [discouraged] Raves due the large drug and alcohol consumption although could not control the spread of the phenomenon. Unfortunately for the Government and the police their attempt to squash the [Hardcore scene] failed, resulting in high-ticket prices for venues being rented especially for Raves. It is believed that over 40% of Rave ticket prices are a direct tax form the government, although this has not discouraged true and loyal Raves. This is evident in recent Raves that are often sold out within a few weeks of tickets being available.
	
	Over the years Hardcore has evolved into a huge underground network. Most big cities in the UK have Hardcore connections, most noticeably the south coast ([Southampton], [Bournemouth] and [Portsmouth]) other northern cities such as Birmingham, Bristol and Nottingham also has underground links with Hardcore. Hardcore has massively evolved since the 80's becoming faster, louder and harder than ever. Hardcore has become noticeably more popular in the 21st century.
	
	The use of alcohol and drugs are a major factor on the Hardcore scene, drugs such as ecstasy, cocaine and MDMA are often associated with Hardcore and the Hardcore scene. The up-tempo beat and melody of the music attracts a variety of different ages, mostly the younger generation, although Hardcore has been recognised and respected by men and woman in there early 40's!
	
	Hardcore is a 21st century phenomenon, becoming more popular and more recognised each year. Events such as [Raver] Baby, [HTID] (Hardcore Till I Die) and [Hardcore Heaven] are massive on the Hardcore scene. Other events such as [Uproar] are also popular amongst Hardcore fans.
	
	Hardcore was known as [happy Hardcore] until the early 90's and was renamed UK Hardcore or Hardcore during the 92-93 period, although is still known by some as Rave and [Happy Hardcore]. Songs such as "[Toytown]" by Adam Hicks ([Hixxy]) was the [pivotal] point for Hardcore, "Toytown" was an exploration [into the unknown] and was one of the first songs which was home to the [breakbeat], fast tempo style which vastly occupies the Hardcore scene today.
	
	Hardcore is partly responsible for the [branching] of genres of music such as drum and bass, techno, dance, garage and UK grime/hip-hop. Hardcore is mostly computer generated, using the latest technology to create a more electric and up-tempo beat than ever before. Hardcore on average plays at about 180 – [220] bpm, depending on the song being played, some songs venture even higher!
	
	Adam Hicks, known as DJ Hixxy is a living legend from the south coast (Portsmouth). He is partly responsible for the new generation of Hardcore, and has been involved in the [makings] of anthems such as "See the Light" and "24/7" and more recently "Take Me to Heaven" and "See of Love. Hixxy is currently in his 30's and still attends huge events such as HTID and Raver Baby. Hixxy is recognised as one of the greatest Hardcore [DJ's] alive, he has successfully carried Hardcore from the slower and less electronic beats to the more recent faster, harder and more vocal beats heard today.
	
	Hixxy was one of the first of the new breed of Hardcore DJ's. DJ's Breeze and [Darren Styles] continued the new and more exciting beats of this "new Hardcore" and old time legends such as [SY] followed suit. Hardcore soon evolved and the older, slower tempo songs soon became known as "Old school". The mid to late 90's saw an unfortunate decrease in the Hardcore scene, songs being made weren’t as popular as before and Hardcore almost became extinct, still up coming DJ's such as Styles and Breeze remained loyal as well as legends such as Hixxy and SY. Hardcore reclaimed its legendary status in 21st century and has since remained popular and well supported.
	
	Since the extraordinary amount of followers during the early 21st century many DJ’s have became involved in the Hardcore movement, DJ’s such as UFO, Slipmatt, Kevin Energy, [Ramos], Supreme, Re-Con, [Dougal], [Sy], Unknown, Scorpio, Hixxy and many more have stayed loyal to the Hardcore scene have performed through thick and thin in an attempt to keep Hardcore alive.
	
	Fortunately for the [Ravers] they succeeded and Hardcore is currently experience a fast increase of popularity and recognition. This is evident to the amount of Hardcore events taking place as well as the rate of new compilations being released, most recently Clubland [X-treme] Hardcore 4. The Clubland X-treme Hardcore series started in 2005 and is a branch off of the hugely successful and still ongoing Clubland series. The Clubland X-treme Hardcore series was one of the first compilations to include “new Hardcore” and has since been a massive success. Each release has seen Styles mix CD 1, Breeze CD 2 and Hixxy CD 3.
	
	Other compilations such as the [Bonkers] collections have also been hugely popular. Bonkers was first released in 1996 and was mixed by Hixxy and [Sharkey] and has since released 17 different compilations as well as Best of Bonkers. Bonkers have seen CD’s mixed by Dougal, Sy, [Scott Brown], Breeze and Styles, Re-Con, Marc Smith, [Neophyte], CLSM, Kutski, [Gammer], Druid, [Brisk] and Ham and Kevin Energy. 
	
	Hardcore is showing no sign of slowing down or becoming extinct. Events hit the country weekly and new breeds of DJ are being produced daily. Hardcore is expected to continue running the underground music scene. More and more people are becoming interested in UK Hardcore from around the globe and Ravers are staying loyal through out.  
	
		Example: "I went to [HTID] 26 [Heaven and Hell] last night"
		
		"Me to I got fuking buzzing!!!"
		
		"Yeah and me up for dropping another 3 even though its 10am?"
		
		"Yeah fuck it mate were Hardcore"
		
		As they both alter the state of mind by taking copious amounts of ecstasy they sing -
		
		"Why oh why can’t you just accept it? Because I’m a [Raver] not a fucking drug addict"
		
		Although I have my doubts about the not a drug addict claim!

	World of Warcraft
	The message board for North America server Uldum. 
	
	Like all WoW realm boards: A poorly moderated hang out for the absolute shittiest members of any given server. 
	Only the biggest losers, trolls and [bottomfeeders] of each server tend to inhabit the realm boards, creating a a ridiculous clique of virginal, snarky, staggeringly lame and unfunny, [assbags] that are nearly identical to each and every realm board in existence. 
	
	Seriously, try to differentiate them.
	
	On Uldum, this usually means listening to the pathetic elitists of Poor Play, Gentlemen's Club, [Moskau], Wishmasters, as well as others and a handful of losers who have left but, troll the old boards out of desperation- [Prattle] endlessly using "bad" as a noun, and flinging lame WOW community cliches* and memes around in place of valid thoughts. WoW has the shittiest community of any game and the realm boards are the shittiest of that shit storm. 
	It's like they all fell out of the shit tree, and made sweet love to every branch on the way down, before building a cabin on the lowest branch out of the broken boughs they fucked through and, proceed to live there all year round, with their shit-tree/human children.
	
	It's like someone decided to filter shit out of shit, to make some kind of purified, [super shit] and, the [Uldum realm board] popped out, fully grown with an [Arthas] action figure up it's own ass.
	
	If you ever wanted a [pastey], fat, sweaty teenager/[semi-adult] 
	-whose only experience with a vagina, is sliding out of one- 
	to call you an idiot, because your blibbity-bloo blob trinket is slippity flip flop! Or, that you are "terribad" (I know, awesome wordplay) because your cartoon character is wearing too much eyeliner or resilience or whatever, 
	come to Uldum! Home of the worthless tool.
	
	Here you can see the same small group of sniveling, gutless, assclowns try to act as cool as any basement dwelling, neckbeards 
	-whose only claim to fame is downing some dumbass make believe, dragon with their head literally inserted into their own ass, can- 
	While bragging about how awesome they are at the world's easiest MMO. 
	
	Better [lock up your daughters]! That 90lb. [horse's ass] with the tier 7 shoulders, [backne] and a name that includes "lol" is headed this way! 
	Wow, you can "out DPS" me? Gee, you must have hot and cold running chicks man! 
	
	You know, instead of nobody on Earth giving [a rat's] flying green shit about how hard your mangina cartoon elf can smack around other cartoon fucktards?
	
	Get used to kids dancing for joy when they "troll u" because apparently that is the most amazing thing in the world there.
	
	*It's like a plate of meme, with an extra side of retarded.
		Example: Uldum Realm Board: Come for the [inflated] sense of self worth, leave because everyone there is a complete idiot. DO [NO TRY] TO [REASON WITH] ULDUMITES, THEY ARE NOT CAPABLE OF REASONING.

His Hollow hole is at the base of his throat.

	[Ulquiorra's] release form is yet to be known, but there are many theories on the matter such as some form of feline or reptile. Some people even joke he may end up being [a garbage man] or trash can, due to the fact that in his first appearance he deems everyone he meets as 'trash'.
	
	Popular romantic pairings with Ulquiorra Schiffer are [Grimmjow] Jaegarjaques, Aizen Sousuke, and most annoyingly of all, [Inoue] Orihime.

His outward appearance is odd (like half the characters in the entire series) consisting of deathly pale skin, large and extremely green eyes, jet black hair, and cyan lines running down his face giving him the appearance that he is crying. As well, the remaining parts of his Hollow mask (as he is an [Arrancar]) looks like someone had taken a [Viking's] helmet, chopped it in half, and [super-glued] part of it onto the left side of his head. His Hollow hole is at the base of his throat.
	
	Not only do the tear streaks that run down his face give fans enough grounds to call him "emo" and "emo bitch", but he also has the personality that makes a potato look exciting. Despite this, he still has massive amounts of fangirls.
	
	[Ulquiorra's] release form is yet to be known, but there are many theories on the matter such as some form of feline or reptile. Some people even joke he may end up being [a garbage man] or trash can, due to the fact that in his first appearance he deems everyone he meets as 'trash'.
	
	Popular romantic pairings with Ulquiorra Schiffer are [Grimmjow] Jaegarjaques, Aizen Sousuke, and most annoyingly of all, [Inoue] Orihime.
	
	Ulquiorra's rank among the Espada is fourth, represented by the Gothic four on his chest. He also has the ability to take out his eye and crush it to pass on information, having the eye later regenerate.
	
	2. /verb/ - To be out emo-d, out bitched, deliver less ownage, and out uke-d by someone else.
		Example: Noun
		1. Who's the emo looking kid on the television? Oh wait, that's just [Ulquiorra].
		
		2. When Ulquiorra Schiffer is paired up with [Inoue] [Orihime], my mind implodes due to the complete oddity of it all.
		
		Verb  
		1. Ulquiorra is the only character that can ever master the art of Ulquiorra.

	[Ultima online] or [UO], was one of the first commercial MMORPG. While other MMO try to be a good and fun game, UO aimed something different, more like a [phantasy] life sim, [quasi-]
	real society where you live, breathe and die in. There were player who would be top brand garment shop owners, town 
	thieves, [woodchucks] would sell few thousands of log for carpainter player in in-game-gold or real-money, the carpainter could use [the logs] to make furniture, and wealthy monster hunters with houses would buy furniture so they could decorate homes and invite friends. In rare cases some player were land estates or inter-server-money [exchanger]. 
	 It was designed so that where there were a good hunting place, there were lots of people. Where there were lots of rich people, killers would raid oftain. Because there were killers on the loose, people would bind together as a guild and guard each other. There were afew self proclaimed bounty hounters too.
	 Once the disgner team promised players that worlds would be without restrictions ,no nurturing from the server moderators/game designers, self governed and self managed by player themselves, but that never came true (except for the dedicated hard core servers Seige Perilous and [Mugen], of wich Mugen thrived at first then quickly dwindled to a tickle), and with each passing patch, UO became more and more [care bear] like, [spoon fed] nurturing game. This was probably because they were wishing player would restrain them selves, rely on good taste, would mind their manners-
	most of the time, and most importantly knowing that something can be done is not something that should be done every five minutes. 
		Example: [Ultima] Online-they created [worlds].

	(2004-07-21 +336/-194)
	Once the greatest game I ever played. Gotten [exponentially] worse every year. Technically dead when Age of [shadows] (See: [ruination]) blew over.
		Example: [Ultima online] was once a [great game] - [Eddie Murphy]

	(2004-03-26 +49/-29)
	A once great and successful MMORPG that was [nerfed] beyond recognition in '00-'01... Despite the fact much was nerfed/neon colored the game still held good PvP after '00, however, with its newest release [AoS] (Age of Shadows) The last shred of what once was UO has become a [diablo 2] knock off.
		Example: [EA] Sucks they destroyed Ultima Online, [I remember] when I played [that game] like it was my life back in '98

	(2003-05-05 +22/-11)

		<B-Zor> YOU SON OF A...
		B-Zor has been slain.

	(2006-07-03 +30/-16)
	Once the greatest game of all time. Then [AOS] (Age of Shadows) was released and the game went down hill then and every year after.
	
	Was a great game to grief and harrass other players. Now full of [trammy] noobs who are [all worried] about rares. 
		Example: I made over $5000 on an [Ultima Online] player ran [shard]. I won [UO] more than once.

	(2005-01-09 +30/-23)
	Fun game for the first few months after that its pretty boring but you just cant stop playing!
	
	Do not pay [monthly] for [ultima]!!! play the free versions!!! age of [shadows] sucks! I say go with UOR or even better pre UOR.

Ultimate Frisbee
	(2004-06-26 +749/-246)
	Best game. [Ultimate] [players] play [for the love of the game].
		Example: [Dad]: Where were you?
		Me: Playing [ultimate frisbee].
		Dad: Who won?
		Me: Nobody, we play [for the fun] of it...
		Dad: Weird.

	(2016-06-04 +17/-8)
	Outstanding game. Good fun among men and women of all ages.
	
	The sport is sort of like a combination of football, rugby, and handball. Each team is allowed seven players on the field at a time. The game begins with the defense performing a "kickoff" by throwing the Frisbee to the offense. The offense retrieves the disk and begins their trek down the field. The teams can score one point by completing a successful pass into the other [end zone].
	
	The player who is in possession of the disk cannot move and can only pivot and throw. Turn overs occur after a score or failed pass. Defensive players are permitted to block and [intercept] passes. A foul occurs when any contact is made between a defensive player and an offensive player.
	
	There are many different types of throws to be used in [Ultimate Frisbee]. The major ones include:backhand, [forehand/flick], hammer, push pass, roller, [scuber], wheeler, and many more. I won't go into how to perform each throw but the internet is a great source to learn any of these.
	
	The two major [ultimate Frisbee] leagues are Major League Ultimate ([MLU]) and American Ultimate Disk League (AUDL). AUDL has 25 teams, while MLU is a smaller league with only 8 teams. (The Philadelphia Spinners are part of the MLU.)
	
	Some Ultimate enthusiasts speculate that the sport has a good chance of entering the Olympics within the next decade. It is one of the fastest growing sports of all time.
	
	Its a great sport to try out and get you [up and running].
		Example: Person 1: What sports can we play? We've [gotten] tired of all the [generic] sports.
		Person 2: If you want, I can call some guys over to play some Ultimate [Frisbee]?
		Person 1: That's a great idea! I'll go grab the Frisbee!

	(2006-11-16 +206/-165)
	Also reffered to as 'Ultimate' A [great game] that is [sweeping] [the nation], and that only fags could dislike
		Example: Who's [up for] [a game] of Ultimate Frisbee?

	(2010-12-21 +49/-42)
	Sometimes known as simply Ultimate is a game played usually with friends in [a pick] up game, but sometimes in organized league play in a tournament and such. All you need to play is some friends and a disc that weighs [175] grams. Unlike most definitions for this on this website, it's harder then it looks, and it takes much more athleticism then you think to play. It takes good endurance and [cardio], because the game is almost entirely running, and throwing a good Frisbee to someone who's cutting and hitting them in [stride] when it's windy is no [easy task]. One of the best parts is that it's usually played for fun, with a score being fun to fun.
		Example: Bro: Hey dude, wanna go play some Ultimate Frisbee?
		Other Bro: [Hell yeah dude], I'll be there.
		Bro: [Sweet bro], it'll be [numb].

	(2011-10-26 +28/-33)
	An actual sport, also known as [ultimate], [ultimate frisbee] is a game where two teams of 7 try to get the [disc] into their endzone without running while having the disc or dropping it
		Example: Hater:Ultimate [Frisbee] isn't a [real sport]
		Frisbee Player: Ultimate Frisbee is so a sport, what do you play, [lacrosse]?

	(2014-12-22 +36/-61)
	Lame, gay, boring. The worst game invented. Requires the athletic skill and talent equivalent to sweeping [a floor]. Great way for stoned hippies to [work off] their [meager] energy..
		Example: Hey Dave do you want to go to the Gay bar? their having an [ultimate frisbee] [comp] today.
		
		No thanks man, I'm gonna sit here and finish my [cheetos]...

	(2008-10-28 +125/-270)
	Quite possibily the worst game ever invented. For people that are [worthless], and good at nothing else. [No skill] necessary, no refs, or anything else that defines [a sport].
		Example: "[I would rather] eat [skunk] shit than play [ultimate frisbee]."

	(2009-09-10 +23/-65)
	1. The best game where one can lay [a beat] down just to get a point and not get in trouble for it.

		"[It's okay], it's [ULTIMATE Frisbee]." ^_^

Ultimate GFE
	(2008-07-28 +209/-70)
	Ultimate [GFE] ([Girl Friend Experience])--when a prostitute behaves like her [client's] girlfriend in bed. A "regular" GFE experience will necessarily include kissing (both Light French and Deep French kissing), cuddling, and a generally unrushed experience. Ultimate GFE adds to this full and complete bareback sex (both oral and vaginal), much as one would do with one's girlfriend. An Ultimate GFE, in bed, is therefore completely indistinguishable from being with one's girlfriend.
		Example: "Dude, that chick I picked up on [TER] gave me an [ultimate GFE] experience...even got to [cream] inside of her."

Sometimes text is included and sometimes they are in a multi-panel form like a Dinosaur Hed, a similar meme from the Lostpedia Forums. Other members of the forum have also taken to making these. The name references the various faces that Matthew Fox makes while playing the character of Jack, which have become known as Jackfaces.

	Boy, I am so glad nobody else did this. Ultimate Team has ruined all of [EA's] sports games such as Madden, FIFA, and NBA Live. Ultimate Team features [microtransactions], which means that probably lots of people are going to spend money on Ultimate Team. It worked.

[floatin'] through the veins... and the power of the Warriaaaaaaaah...

	Used to be popular in the 80's - 90's [WWF], even though he was as talented and a retarded stick, he couldn't even speak a coherent sentence or speak clearly and he tired himself out as he ran to the ring.
	
	He is a homophobe and think his opinions are the only correct ones. He's also a complete douchebag.
	
	He now owns a YouTube channel and uses it to promote his
	
	"One Warrior Nation" movement that promotes the belief that your life is inferior, and his is so fucking awesome. He also used this channel to attack [Hulk Hogan], after he talked shit about the legendary [Randy Savage], however Hoagn is probably even a bigger douchebag than Warrior, brother.
	
	[Warrior's] methods of doing videos are:
	
	1) Working out 'till he turns purple (The steroids)
	
	2) Shouting arrogant shit at his iPhone while it's recording
	
	3) Finishing with a completely random, plagiarized motto/slogan to try and motivate you to make your life as good as he thinks his is.

Then someone dressed in traditional [ultimate warrior] gear(tights, facepaint, muscle tassels, knee pads, elbow pads, and boots) bust through a door or window. (possibly a wall)  He then proceeds to wreck everything that gets in his way, escape anyone who opposes him, and shake any ropes that are avaliable.

	A sexual position where you and your lover can both watch "[The Ultimate Warrior's] All-Time Greatest Matches DVD" and if not available, a self-recorded tape of his Wrestlemania 6 fight against Hulk Hogan will do. Right when your girl is about to reach her climax (preferably in a physical position where your two shadows cast upon a nearby wall will make out to look like The Ultimate Warrior mining for Riaken fuel), once she nears climax you start beating the piss out of her, throwing tomahawk elbows and nasty moon-a-saults, punches and nuclear leg-drops will suffice as well. When she is naked and badly injured, you then yell and chant [the Ultimate Warrior's] theme song, while stomping around the room.

	(2006-10-10 +46/-59)
	One of the most popular wrestlers of the late 80's and early 90's.  The [posterboy] for a wrestler who is all show and no talent.  His wrestling ability consist of him running mad-sprint to the ring(usually tiring himself out before the match) then proceeding to shake the ropes as hard as he can.  Once the match actually started his greeness was very apparent.  The man couldn't even perform his trademark move correctly and actually hurt other wrestlers in doing so.  The reason why the Warrior was so popular was plain and simple...he looked cool.  Complete with a cut muscular body he also had huge feathered hair which would have made Bon Jovi jealous.  He had a streamers flailing from his arms and bright colored [facepaint].  The Warrior has been noted as a strange man, yes his name is legally The Warrior.  To say the least [the Ultimate Warrior] is or was the worst Heavyweight Champion ever!
		Example: [Ha], [Ultimate Warrior] [fucked up] another move!

	(2007-09-23 +132/-27)
	Also known as [UG], originally started as a guitar tabulature website, with a forum added later. It has become (one of) the biggest guitar site(s) on the internet, possibly one of the biggest sites on the internet. It is infamous among its members for the "Pit", its miscellaneous forum which acts as a black hole, [doubling] as a killer of social lives. The Pit is no killer,just pure filler, as its many thousands of viewers babble on and on, recycling 4chan memes, as well as spamming, flaming, and generally talking bullshit. Its power remains unexplained. 
	
	The rest of the site is relatively harmless, although stocked with both intellectuals and imbeciles as it is.
	
	www.[ultimate-guitar.com] 
		Example: Where [lives] once may have [flourished], [ultimate-guitar.com] has taken them

	(2008-01-22 +32/-28)
	 [Ultimate-guitar] is an awesome website in which individuals from [all over the world] can meet and [converse], having highly intelligent conversations and sharing knowledge on all aspects of music.

	(2005-12-27 +18/-17)
	A website/forum with great guitar tablatures. It has some awesome guitarists that tab songs and even make instructional videos.
	
	Unfortunatley the forum community is mostly made up of dumbass high school freshmen who want to learn to play [power chords] like their hero, [Billy Joe Armstrong]. And God forbid when they try to tab something simple like a pop-punk song, they [fuck it up] somehow.
	
		Example: If you're a good guitarist who doesn't think that My Chemical Romance and [Avenged Sevenfold] are [the pinnacle] of musicianship, come check out [Ultimate-Guitar].
		
		If you picked up the guitar to try to get pussy, stay the fuck away.

	(2008-03-19 +14/-31)
	A large guitar tab website with forums and news. If the article is created and it's about a band, the members will find anything, making sense or not, to [bitch about]. It is apparant that being a member of the [UG] Forums is contradictory in itself because the members are in a music community, but they clearly dislike all music and have to find some way to slander it so they can seem like [badasses] to their homies. They are also known to have poor grammar.
		Example: insert [band name] are shit. insert lead singers name NOT [capitalized], [mind you] is a fag and needs to die
		
		- Typical quote of an ultimate-guitar member.

	AKA UG; The Pit; Russian-servers-are-located-here!; [Kensai's] Dungeon; Hell; [HEEEEEEY]!!
	
	A community that will overtake 4Chan one day. Needless to say, UG is a pretty awesome website. It's filled with video lessons, tablature, reviews and [Guitar Pro] files that will teach you how to be an aspiring guitarist, probably better than douchebags like Lil Wayne UG has also installed widgets for members so if you check them out, they are so rad (wow, I sound like a chav)
	
	UG is also popular for one thing: The Pit, where all 14-year olds, who are regular fappers and have no life at all (I just kid..) The Pit is seriously weird but you'll seem to like every user that you'll see, unless you're a girl. It is filled with every meme possible and ridiculous news. If you're addicted to the Pit, you're called a [Pit Monkey] - idk wtf that means.
		Example: BOY 1: Dude, wtf should we do now?
		BOY 2: Idk...
		BOY 1: How about [fapping]?
		BOY 2: No, let's visit [Ultimate-Guitar.com]
		BOY 1: You're [no f]*cking guitarist
		BOY 2: =D

	(2006-02-28 +399/-151)
	A Massachusetts public institution of higher learning located in the middle of nowhere aka Amherst, Massachusetts. The location leads to the insane amount of partying that occurs, since there is nothing better to do. For the academic year of 2005-2006, [UMass] Amherst (Also known as [Zoomass] or Zoomass-Slamherst) was rated by [the Princeton Review] as the #9 party school in the country. ABC also rated it the most violent campus in the nation, but this was based on skewed numbers and outdated facts. UMass is home to [Sylvan] Residence Area, rated as one of the most sexually active campus residences in the country. Despite this, and noted Sylvanites such as [Frank Black] of the Pixies, Sylvan tends to be the last choice for residence for all incoming and current students due to its distance from the parties and campus center. UMass is home to world-reknowned Polymer studies and Linguistics programs, and the [Isenberg] School of Management rates among many Ivy League business schools as the best in the country. The most popular majors are Biological and Physical Sciences, Communications, and Psychology. It has an undergraduate enrollment of over 18,000 and is growing larger by the year.
		Example: Well, I got into all the [schools] I [applied] to, but I can only afford UMass Amherst.

	Short for Umineko no [Naku] [Koro] ni, a badass murder-mystery anime series aired in Japan between July 2nd and December 24th, 2009. It deals with the events that unfold on the fictional island of Rokkenjima when the head of an incredibly rich family calls the entire family to the island to discuss the distribution of the family's wealth in the event of [the head's] death.
	
	However, mysterious deaths start occurring the first night on the island, with everything somehow tying into the legend of the "Golden Witch," Beatrice -- who is rumored to have been a [close acquaintance] of the family head. [Battler] Ushiromiya (that's right, his name is fucking [BATTLER]. It doesn't get much more badass than that), the protagonist of the series, refuses to acknowledge Beatrice, and instead insists that all of the murders can be explained using "real" and "physical" means - even those that seem to be impossible for humans to have accomplished.
	
	Long story short, everybody dies (at least everyone who was on the island), more witches appear than I can even count, and Battler eventually becomes a sorcerer who wields a badass SHINY GOLD LONGSWORD that lets him SPEAK IN BLUE-, RED-, AND EVEN GOLD-COLORED TEXT.

	"[Umlaut]" (m.), noun
	
	The German alphabet consists of 26 characters plus 3 [umlauts]: ä, ö and ü. 
	The two [dots] above the letters do NOT indicate an accentuation or emphasis of the syllable (as for instance accent-bearing letters in Spanish or French). [Umlauts] are used as independent characters in the German language. 
	
	Whenever the use of umlauts is not possible (e.g. for technical reasons, in email addresses or names of websites), umlauts are indicated by the following combinations: 
	“ae” = ä, “[oe]”= ö, “[ue]” = ü.
	
	Note: 
	some proper names contain the converted form of umlauts
	(e.g. the author is spelled [Goethe] NOT Göthe)!
	
	Pronunciation: 
	The letter ä is pronounced like the a in “apple”. 
	The sound of the letter ö is similar to the sound in “earn” or “bird”. 
	The letter ü is the most difficult for those who are learning German. It is the same sound as the u in the French words “[musique]”, “chaussure”, “[rue]”, ... etc.  
	
		Example: [Umlauts] are used in all types of word categories: nouns (not only, but often in the plural form), verbs, adjectives, adverbs, prefixes and prepositions.

	(2009-11-26 +43/-86)
	Vulgar slang. Technically this is the act of depositing half a load of semen onto each of a person's (e.g. an attractive female) two eyes.

A person who is attractive or upon whom it is desirable to perform the act of umlauting is said to be "umlautable". The word "[umlaut]" is often used as a single world exclamation where the term is synonymous (but with more vulgar connotations) with the word "hot".
	
	The term is derived from visual [similarity] of the sexual act upon the eyes to the diacritical [marking] of two [dots] appearing over a vowel in [Germanic] languages.
		Example: "That chick was so [smokin'] I umlauted [right on] her eyes."

Umop the Clown
	(2008-07-19 +61/-10)
	[Umop] the Clown is a fictional character created in October 2003 during a [Dungeons & Dragons] game. The word 'down' was written on the game map, which was misread as "[umop]" and became a source of humor for the gaming group. When Nick, the [Dungeon Master], grew frustrated with the joke and re-wrote the word in a vain attempt to put a stop to the silliness, the word 'down' was re-interpreted as "clown," and thus was born "Umop the Clown."
	
	His eponymous theme song was written and performed a few weeks after his creation by band Dinzer, with the main vocals performed by Don and Nick.
	
	In the song, Umop is revealed to wear a hospital gown while obsessively driving around the city in search of a fruit-flavored food called "Fruit Sucky."
	
	Umop the Clown has a backstory, written some years after his initial creation, that parallels the story of Anakin Skywalker in the Star Wars films.
		Example: Jack "What's [umop]?"
		
		Nick "That's not umop, it's down ... you're just reading it upside-down."
		
		Jack "No, look at how you wrote it, it looks like umop."
		
		Nick "Fine, I'll rewrite it, just for you."
		
		Glenn "Now it looks like clown."
		
		Nick *Fuming* "You guys suck."
		
		...
		
		Don *[Strumming] at his guitar*
		
		Lindsay "I'm really craving something fruity right now. Remember how I used to come over here after school and drink your [Capri] Suns?"
		
		Nick "We don't have any [Capri Sun] right now, but we might have some Popsicles... let me check."
		
		Nick *Returning* "No Popsicles. I'm sure if we had any, they'd be in a big [yellow box] labeled 'Fruit Sucky,' or something."
		
		Don *Strumming at his guitar*
		
		...
		
		I am [Umop] the Clown/I like to be upside-down/I like spinning 'round and 'round/I want my Fruit Sucky sucky.

uncanniness
	(2009-03-03 +211/-44)
	The Uncanny is a [Freudian] concept of an instance where something can be familiar, yet foreign at the same time, resulting in a feeling of it being uncomfortably strange.
	
	Because the uncanny is familiar, yet strange, it often creates [cognitive dissonance] within the experiencing subject due to the [paradoxical] nature of being attracted to, yet repulsed by an object at the same time. This cognitive dissonance often leads to an outright rejection of the object, as one would rather reject than rationalize.
	
	
		Example: The state is first identified by [Ernst] Jentsch in a 1906 essay, On the Psychology of the Uncanny. Jentsch defines the Uncanny as: "doubts whether an apparently [animate] being is really alive; or conversely, whether a lifeless object might be, in fact, animate", and expands upon its use in fiction:
		
		“ In telling a story one of the most successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or an [automaton] and to do it in such a way that his attention is not focused directly upon his uncertainty, so that he may not be led to go into the matter and [clear it] up immediately.
		

	(2005-03-08 +246/-107)
	feeling [strange],[unable] to [press on] why
		Example: i am [feeling] uncanny about [taking] up this [job].

	[Freud] specifically relates an aspect of the Uncanny derived from German etymology. By contrasting the German adjective unheimlich with its [base word] [heimlich] ("concealed, hidden, in secret"), he proposes that social taboo often yields an aura not only of pious reverence but even [moreso] of horror and even disgust, as the taboo state of an item gives rise to the commonplace assumption that that which is hidden from public eye (cf. the eye or sight metaphor) must be a dangerous threat and even an abomination - especially if the concealed item is obviously or presumingly sexual in nature. Basically, the Uncanny is what unconsciously reminds us of our own Id, our forbidden and thus [repressed] impulses perceived as a threatening force by our super-ego ridden with [oedipal] guilt as it fears symbolic [castration] by punishment for deviating from societal norms. Thus, the items and individuals that we project our own repressed impulses upon become a most uncanny threat to us, uncanny monsters and freaks akin to fairy-tale folk-devils, and subsequently often become scapegoats we blame for all sorts of perceived miseries, calamities, and maladies.

uncanny
	(2009-03-03 +211/-44)
	The Uncanny is a [Freudian] concept of an instance where something can be familiar, yet foreign at the same time, resulting in a feeling of it being uncomfortably strange.
	
	Because the uncanny is familiar, yet strange, it often creates [cognitive dissonance] within the experiencing subject due to the [paradoxical] nature of being attracted to, yet repulsed by an object at the same time. This cognitive dissonance often leads to an outright rejection of the object, as one would rather reject than rationalize.
	
	
		Example: The state is first identified by [Ernst] Jentsch in a 1906 essay, On the Psychology of the Uncanny. Jentsch defines the Uncanny as: "doubts whether an apparently [animate] being is really alive; or conversely, whether a lifeless object might be, in fact, animate", and expands upon its use in fiction:
		
		“ In telling a story one of the most successful devices for easily creating uncanny effects is to leave the reader in uncertainty whether a particular figure in the story is a human being or an [automaton] and to do it in such a way that his attention is not focused directly upon his uncertainty, so that he may not be led to go into the matter and [clear it] up immediately.

Uncanny Valley
	(2006-08-06 +324/-38)
	 First theorized by Japanese [roboticist] Masahiro [Mori] in 1970, the Uncanny Valley basically states that the closer a robot or other [nonhuman] entity gets to resembling a human, the more humans will like and empathize with it.
	
	 However, there is a point in development where humans instead become strongly repulsed by the barely-human robot/entity. Fortunately, this effect fades as the robot/entity becomes less distinguishable from a human.
	
	 Although [hotly] debated, the theory is present in many sci-fi movies and the like, and has been used to explain people's reactions to some computer generated characters.
		Example:  I can't [get into] "[Rumble Roses]" because the girls [just don't] look quite right to me. I guess it's the Uncanny Valley at work.

UNCC
	(2009-07-25 +491/-346)
	A small school located in [Charlotte, NC] with the only people who know about the school are the people who attend it. An underdog school with its fans always having to make up excuses that their school is better in any form than yours.
	
	UNCC students go on tantrums when they are addressed by their ACTUAL name, UNCC. They prefer to be named Charlotte so they aren't confused by the more well known and highly accredited [UNC Chapel Hill]. Many students want to break away from the UNC system and go by the name of University of Charlotte... which will only make the school go under the college radar even more!
	
	Students who attend UNCC are typically people who chose the school as their "[back-up plan]", people who don't like to be too far from home, people who have an [inflated ego] and can't accept the truth.
	
	The students will always claim that they have more school spirit than yours, and that is because they know they are lacking too many features of a real university.
	
	In a nut shell - One step higher than a community college.
	(Although some people already mistake it for one!)
		Example: UNCC Student: Well MY football team is the [49ers]!!
		
		Careless bystander: You mean the one that won't even be around until 2013..?
		
		UNCC Student: Well we got a BRAND NEW Student Union!!
		
		Careless bystander: Oh.. that's cool.. its only taken say.. 60 years?
		
		UNCC Student: Yea.. well.. [we BEAT] your school in [underwater basket weaving] the other day!!
		
		Careless bystander: (Sighs in sympathy..)

	(2011-08-03 +129/-106)
	[Money Pit]. Because the place is a [money pit], students rarely graduate in four years, and it is way to expensive. It also sucks the light out of everything. So if you enjoy [your social life] do not come here. It should be used as more of an insult.
		Example: Person 1: Nice! I got accepted to UNCC.
		Person 2: What? Oh you mean [the money] [pit]. [Good luck] my friend...

More than 70,000 living alumni -- with an addition of 4,000 to 4,500 new alumni annually - are a testament to the strength of the students in the university community.

	Student-Faculty Ratio- 15:1
	
	The best school in the UNC system.
	Great Nursing program and one of the top Business programs in the country.
	
	Has one of the two architectural schools in the state of North Carolina.

	A law used to describe a person of a different race who attempts to assimilate an "African American person." Those with this complex try to "act, speak, and look" like an African American based on [the celebrities], media, and music they follow and listen to, and based on the way [AAs] are represented in each, but ultimately end up looking culturally insensitive. Basically [a black man's] weeaboo. They disrespect the culture and make themselves seem as if they have the brain capacity of a horse. This complex is named after the character of [Uncle Ruckus] from "The Boondocks."
	
	*Keep in mind that is possible for a non African American person to like and respect the culture and history of the race, which prevents them from having this complex. It is also possible for the complex to stem from a purely racist standpoint rather than one bought about by the media. However in most situations, the latter ends up being the case.*
		Example: White male:"Yo mah nigga dam right I popped a cap in dat [gay ass bitch] [ass faggot] fool. I be the realest g in da hood fam. I smoke so much a dat kush yo. I be da best why da fuck you lyin' and denyin homie? Now where my ho at? She need to be all up on my nuts bruh."

		White male:"[Wuzzat] bruh?"
		
		Black male:"You clearly have A Reverse Uncle Ruckus Complex."

Uncle Tron
	(2011-05-29 +59/-15)
	An Uncle Tron is a stereotypical presentation of a member of a traditionally nerdy or geeky [subculture] that is meant to both represent or appeal to that subculture. It is more often than not presented in a way that would be outrageously offensive to any other subculture or minority group that society has deemed it [politically incorrect] to make fun of, e.g., blacks, Jews, or women. Just like other stereotypes, they're presented merely to give the audience someone to laugh at, in this instance, "geeks". This is contrasted with actual nerd-humor from shows such as "[Futurama]".
		Example: The Big Bang Theory is a modern [minstrel show] featuring Uncle [Trons] as their main protagonists.
		
		Sheldon: I just but a Nintendo 64 off of ebay last night. Once it gets here I'm going to leave it in the package and argue on the webernets with people about how [I'm superior] to everyone for owning one.

Unconditional Love
	(2017-05-08 +104/-11)
	is known as affection without any limitations or love without conditions. This term is sometimes associated with other terms such as true [altruism] or complete love. Each area of expertise has a certain way of describing [unconditional love], but most will agree that it is that type of love which has no bounds and is unchanging. It is a concept comparable to true love, a term which is more frequently used to describe love between lovers. By contrast, unconditional love is frequently used to describe love between family members, comrades in arms and between others in highly committed relationships. An example of this is a parent's love for their child; no matter a test score, a life changing decision, an argument, or a strong belief, the amount of love that remains between this bond is seen as unchanging and [unconditional]. A common (and [ableist]) misconception is that one must love themselves first before being capable of unconditional love; this is simply not true.
		Example: His mother had Unconditional Love for him even though he [comitted] a [heinous] [murder]

	(2005-03-30 +917/-258)

	(2016-07-28 +41/-12)
	[To love] [someone] with [no strings attached].

	(2006-05-16 +518/-225)
	100% of love for your lover/ or maybe close member of your family or whatever but most used with a lover.

	(2005-07-15 +29/-3)
	Not being conscious. When a person becomes or appears to be unconscious, they appear to be in a sleep-like unresponsive state, where all muscles become relaxed and 'floppy'. This creates a danger to [the patient's] life, as their tongue (a muscle) rolls to the back of the throat, and blocks the [airway]. Also, as the patient regains consciousness, their stomach wall contracts, causing the contents of their bowels to be forced up the oesophagus where it would enter the mouth to be drained, but because the tongue is blocking it's way, a sufficient amount of vomit enters the lungs, and the patient therefore drowns on their own sick.
	
	To prevent this, simply check the patient's airway and breathing. If they are breathing, place them into the recovery position. If not, seek help immediately and make sure someome trained in [first aid] is present to perform [CPR] until paramedics arrive.
		Example: Unconsciousness - (noun) 1.The state of lacking [consciousness], of being [unconscious].
		
		2.Ignorance or [innocence]; the state of being uninformed or unaware.

Unconventionality
	(2018-09-28 +88/-53)
	Someone who looks average looking at first glance (and not the type to get the hottest dating partners),
	however, upon closer look,
	
	their "average looks" interestingly, and deceptively are an illusion,
	and can still use their looks to attract women/men.
	
	Why?
	Because physical attraction is *binary*.
	A person with even just a few physical flaws can still pull the best since they're 'good looking enough'
	
	Unfortunately, only ~20% of average looking people can use the title of [unconventionally attractive].
	
	[The missing link] for the remaining 80% of average looking people is lack of [babyface], youth, head full of hair, exoticness (this is where race comes into play), and innocence.
	
	Some of the most popular types of unconventionally attractive men include:
	babyface boyish dudes
	above average looking ethnic men that (Hollywood-based) society would consider a 6/10 in looks
	
	NOTE:
	
	[Unconventionally attractive] is NOT personality-based.
		Example: Chad: "Yo how the FUCK did is that boyish Indian guy going out with that hot blonde? I thought that ONLY buff tall guys like me with pronounced eye ridge, sharp jaw, hunter eyes, caucasian, and long wavy hair are qualified for girls THAT pretty. Must be his personality..."
		Bill: "NO. It's not his personality. It's unironically his looks, believe or not. You see, he's unconventionally attractive, physically. Hot girls don't necessarily choose the 'best looking' guy by [conventional standards]. Surprise! All 200 million pretty women don't have the same exact taste in men. Stacy over there unironically REALLY digs effimate [prettyboy] types rather than [beefcakes], so in a way, her pussy doesn't get wet when she sees you, mr.chad.
		Chad: What is life... I've been lied to all this time. (mind explodes)

During [these times], the excess names of [the sick] were recorded in the next column, which was reserved for the weather conditions of the day.  Thus, it was not unusal for an ill sailor to be listed "under the weather".

Underage Drinking
	(2007-01-11 +592/-137)
	1. Something that is punishable only in the U.S.
	
	2. Something that 18, 19, and 20 year olds can be charged with in the U.S. due to their [fascist] [drinking laws].
	
	3. Something they don't allow 18, 19, and 20 year old American soldiers to do before they come home from Iraq in pieces with only an [American flag] handed to their family for comfort.
	
		Example: (in the U.S.) You are a month away from your [21st birthday] and are drinking a beer! Thats [underage drinking]!
		
		(everywhere else) Hahahaha look at that [stupid drunk] 15 year old!

	(2009-11-28 +88/-29)
	Something that [everybody] does at one point in time but is [illegal] in the US until the age of [21].
		Example: Damn, i can [die] for my country but i can't drink a [beer] because it's Underage Drinking. Fuck. I'm [moving].

	(2004-11-26 +331/-243)
	[Fun] [ass shit]! We [all love] it!
		Example: [UMMM] in [Airdrie] there is [nothin] better to do! Plus you get more bitches when ur drunk!

	(2011-11-14 +27/-45)
	An activity commonly engaged in by people who are too young to legally drink, too [unimaginative] to do anything interesting or healthy, and too afraid of being found out as [bores] to interact with other people when they're sober.
	
	Unfortunately, most underage drinkers remain dull and uncomfortable with themselves after they turn into regular drinkers who don't need to use fake [IDs] to sneak cheap beer and liquor.
		Example: I wanted my roommate to meet you guys, so I invited him to come with us on this hike. When he found out that we weren't bringing any alcohol, and that we were just going to take some sandwiches and try out my new camera, he decided he'd rather sit on his ass in his room getting drunk and [watching cartoons] on DVD.
		
		It's too bad, because he's been complaining about how fat he's getting, and we must've burned about 1000 calories today. He always says he's bored, but every time somebody invites him to do anything other than drink he turns them down and says whatever they're doing is stupid. It's like he thinks that if [underage drinking] isn't involved, it can't be interesting. I think he would have liked seeing those [bald eagles] trying to catch fish and those hot girls we passed by the bridge. He played basketball in high school; maybe that game we're planning for next week won't be too "boring" for him.
		
		Hopefully by the time I get home he'll be too drunk to yell at the television, but not so drunk that he's puking or blacked out. Had to call an ambulance for him last month when he blacked out; that was lame. I'm also tired of hearing him bitch about having trouble getting up for his classes - if he didn't stay up drinking most nights he wouldn't have [such a problem].
		
		But really - he's a cool guy when he's sober.

	(2007-05-11 +243/-174)
	[The only] [thing] that makes adolencense [worth] while.

		Example: If that is [not a] [deliberate] underboob, [I don't know what] is.

	(2005-02-21 +963/-281)
	Hands down, one of the finest aspects of a woman's anatomy that can be enjoyed in any public venue.  
	
	[Underboob] is achieved by wearing a very short [halter top] or cropped tank, also known as an [underboob shirt], which exposes the bottom areas of a woman's breasts.  
	
	Much like the combination of low-rise jeans and a thong, the underboob shirt can only successfully be worn by select few women.
		Example: In an [ideal situation], a hottie will wear an [underboob shirt] to accessorize her low-rise jeans/thong combination.  When this happens, all men in the vicinity will regard her as "hot" or "a sexy bitch", while their wives/girlfriend may refer to her as "trashy" or "a [slutty bitch]", but that's okay.

This can be particularly unattractive as during vigorous sex, it may swing from side to side, back and forth, much like a [metronome]. In extreme cases, the folds of fat, or female breasts, may slap together making a sound not dissimilar to the sound of a [sealion] performing for food at shows at many [zoos]. This noise is known as flap or tat slapping.
		Example: "Dude, I was fucking Cindy in the ass"
		"Awesome dude! How was it?"

Underclassed
	(2009-07-17 +83/-25)
	Term used to seperate the working class from the "does not work, will not work and has never worked" classes
	
	The underclass usually occupy perfectly good council houses and then proceed to litter their gardens with [fridges], [dog turds], fast food boxes and other assorted items. The underclass enjoy decorating the inside of their houses in much the same manner and despite the apparent poverty in most other aspects of their lives they will still manage to afford a very large [plasma] t.v. (which is to be left on at all times)
	
	The occupants of these buildings will almost certainly be claiming the following benefits
	
	Child benefits- for their numerous offspring
	Disability benefits- see "nerves", "depression" "ADHD" etc
	[Job Seeker] Allowence- For not [looking for a job]
	Housing benefit-
	
	Please note that despite all of this the undeclasses still feel victimised particularly when their drunken domestic incidents are broken up by the police at 2am.
	
	It should be noted that under no circumstances should a member of the middle class attempt to blame the underclass' [woeful] existence actually on the underclass, as the underclass will immediately find blame anywhere else. Because surely their total lack of motivation and morals is the fault of society.
		Example: working class- I need [benefits] to help look after [my child]
		
		underclass- I need a child to [help me] get benefits

	People who [populate] the more impoverished sections of the working class and who are collectively blamed for a host of social [ills].  People who due to their financial circumstances are unable to participate in mainsream society.
	
	People perceived to be of no good to society and so those parents who do work hard in such [adverse] circumstances are stigmatised as wrong and deviant due to [assumptions] based on the actions of a minority. Their children do not receive the support they need to help them advance away from poverty.
	
	Instead of being called deserving, hard working, or if unemployed are helped to gain meaningful work, security and education, ALL poor people are somehow deemed to be scroungers and layabouts.
		Example: The elderly
		
		Mentally ill
		
		Single parents
		
		Immigrants
		
		[Asylum] [seekers]
		
		[Manual] workers................

	(2007-09-14 +36/-2)
	The latest album by the very successful band Sum 41.
	
	It is their first album since guitarist David "[Brownsound]" Baksh left.
	
	They did, however, incorporate another guitarist for recording and touring, Thomas "Brown Tom" Thacker, but will not include him in band photos or the crew list.
	
	The new album includes hits such as Underclass Hero, Walking Disaster, and March of the Dogs. The other songs are Speak of the Devil, Dear Father, Count your last blessings, Ma [Poubelle], The Jester, With me, [Pull the curtain], King of Contradiction, Best of me, Confusion and Frustration in modern times, and So Long Goodbye.
	
	I recommend this album to any fan of the band. Actually, I recommend it to anybody.
		Example: [Just picked up] Underclass Hero. It's [amazing], dude.

	An Undercover Slut is a guy or girl who seems quite innocent and maybe even a bit prude but is actually a [sexual deviant] when given the chance to be. Being that the person is generally quiet and reserved about said deviancy, it's quite surprising when they reveal their true colors and you often find yourself very, VERY [intrigued] and wanting more. Just remember that they are, in fact, undercover, and have to [uphold] their mild-mannered alter-ego when exposed to the general public, and you must respect that. Also, don't assume that they've hooked up with tons of people- most Undercover Sluts like to reserve their [sluttiness] as to keep it meaningful and, obviously, undercover.
	It's sort of like when the chick in the movie takes off her glasses and pulls her hair down and straddles you and you get the idea.
		Example: Guy 1: "Hey, you know that chick [Gracie]?"
		Guy 2: "The one who always gets [like, really] [good grades]? Yeah, what about her?"
		Guy 1: "That party last night, dude... You wouldn't be able to tell, but she is a MAJOR Undercover Slut."

underground hip hop
	(2005-03-06 +401/-149)
	A non commerical genre of rap music that
	actually in my opinion has more [originality] and talent than most commercialized shit on TV. The Deftinitive [Jux] label is a fine example
	of oiginal hip hop, if ya havent [checked out] that label, type up www.definitivejux.com.

		an intense, [intellegent] [lyrical] discharge.

	(2010-07-11 +38/-364)
	1. The Underground Hip Hop Syndrome, or simply UHH Syndrome, is the process of not agreeing with someone and removing their definitions from this website. I had 2 definitions of 'underground hip hop' posted here just recently, until some sick deranged [spambot] decided to remove it. This is not a threat, just the truth...now that's only ONE side of the story.
	2. The other side is their 'dark' side, as I proclaim it to be. The fans love their artists to a certain extent. ONE music video made by their favorite artist and they will claim that the artist/group lost it's 'talent and luster'. Anyone who disagrees with me is just ignoring the truth. It seems as if rappers like Immortal Technique don't deserve more fans than they already have...hell, I wouldn't mind seeing him go mainstream. Lupe Fiasco is mainstream and yet he, IMO, is more talented than Immortal Technique.
	
	To the guy who removed my definitions: [TEH INTERNETZ] IZ SRS BUSINESS ([the internet is serious business])
		Example: Now agree with me (the anonymous wimp who removed [my definitions])...if you remove this, then it's obvious you're infected by [the Underground] Hip Hop syndrome. [You poor thing]...

Underground Music
	(2009-07-27 +192/-43)
	Here are a few bullet points:
	
	* Music isn't found on MTV or the radio (unless it's a local or amateur station)
	
	* Does not have concerts taking place in [Stadiums] or huge [Arenas] where you pay 50-80 dollars to get in.The city government do not close roads and check your bags like at a U2 concert.You don't need a pair of binocuolars.
	
	* Will not be found in small(ish) chain record stores.You might find some in larger places in [HMV] if it has some signifigance but Tower Records is ussually better for that kind of stuff.
	
	* Music in which singles are not released on widely available [Compact Discs] featuring 'Radio Edits','Album Versions','Remixes' or 'Music Videos.Instead are released on [7 inch] [Vinyl] Records(7").
	What mainstream listeners don't know is that in fact Vinyl Records are NOT something that people stopped listening to in the early 1980s and that throughout the 90s,Vinyl was the norm for most bands,ignoring [shoddy] cheap CDs and today in the age of [itunes it] is still being used.
	
	* Music in which when the artists tour,they not get by in Fancy tour buses but in vans - ussually where the band will struggle to pay gas.Accomodation ussually consists of the band sleeping on somebodys floor and not in a 4-Star Hotel.
	
	* Music which does not appear on the cover of next months [Kerrang]!,Total Guitar or [Rolling Stone] with an 'exclusive interview'.
	Why?
	
	Because we'd rather read self-published Fanzines used with a [photocopier].
	
	* Music in which Concerts are not advertised taking up whole pages in the National Newspaper.Something more along he lines of the band handing out [flyers] for their next show.
	
	* Music which isn't recorded at fancy studios with famous producers like Flood.
	
	* Music that isn't signed to a sublabel of the loved-to-be-hated [Warner Music Group],Sony,Universal,[EMI] with big Epic sounding names like 'Atlantic','Capitol','Epic'.Nothing that calls themselves a 'Music Group' or 'Corporation'
	Ussually smaller labels set up by bands who release stuff by other bands and don't give loads of crap about Copyright on [the CD] or Record.Simple and modest,and not scaring people telling them they will be [jailed],sentenced to death,Burnt at the stake for public broadcasting,lending,unauthorized copying etc.
	A Good example of a band who are into this thing are [Godspeed You! Black Emperor].If you don''t know of this band or the 'post-rock' genre,please,keep reading.
	
	* Music that doesn't have music videos shot for every single released.As when it comes to underground,a single is not much more than a 7-inch with a song on each side.Often never connected to albums.
	Music videos are just a way of marketing.Most of favourite bands only have one or two music videos of songs that weren't even released as singles.And [thats only] the ones that are on the successful end of Underground.
	
	* Music that will not have live footage shot professionally but by members of the audience who will always be close enough to the band to produce a good video.
	The reasons why mainstream artists need pros to tape their concerts are
	a) The majority of people filming use their phones
	b) The crowd don't know how to shut up,thus blocking the sound on the camera
	c) The people have such a bad taste in video.They'd rather watch what is basically a music video rather than how someone in the audience would see it (and hear it).
	d) It can pass as 'commercial',release it on a DVD or sell it on itunes so the music industry will earn another few million.
		Example: person#1:Guess whats ironic? None of those 7 people over there have heard of Hawthorne Heights? They must be Underground!
		
		person#2:So Fucking what?
		They still appear in [Kerrang]!,the [Warped Tour],and Virgin Megastores.That's NOT [underground music]!

	(2011-04-05 +58/-64)
	A term used by pretentious musical elitists to deflect criticisms and to feel superior. [Underground Music] is simply music that has not yet gained widespread fame and notoriety. Listening to [Underground music] does not make you elite; it only means you discovered it through channels other than popular mass media.
	Many fans of artists like to maintain the label of "Underground" even though the band or artist has gained success and [notability].

They put on an amazing, emotion-driven show and if given the chance to see them, you should. They draw heavily from their Christian beliefs and definitely express these beliefs. But they are not in-your-face Christians. Their lyrics and music truly speak to me and many others who listen to them. The band currently consists of [Spencer Chamberlain] (screamed vocals), [Aaron Gillespie] (drums, singing vocals), Timothy McTague (lead guitar, backing vocals), James Smith (rhythm guitar, Christopher Dudley (keyboards), [Grant Brandell] (bass guitar).

They're talent is wasted on "mainstream loving" teens who don't know a damn thing about good music and only like them in some desperate hope of looking cool and getting laid.  Although not the most musically talented band ever (aka not Rush), they'll rock your socks [any day of the week].

	If you hate UnderOath, love UnderOath, think they copied Alexisonfire, or think they suck now but used to be the best...just know that everybody changes. Pass judgement on them if you like, but you try and hold a band together for  years. Everybody has disagreements. If they only tried to please fans they wouldn't be being themselves. Therefore causing them to be fake. Be pleased they aren't fake.
	
	And fighting over the internet doesn't make you look tough. It shows your ignorance and intolerance. And it's accually funny.

	[Underoos] is undergarments containing pictures, graphics of cartoons character(s) and/or [movie character](s) on a t-shirt sold with a color brief.  These eventually evolved into briefs only and two major underwear manufactures took the concept and branded FunPals/FunGals ([Fruit of the Loom]) and Showtoons ([Hanes]).  These underwear have the cartoons and/or character(s) printed directly on the brief in either multiple impressions or large single impression.  However, these designed were mostly limited to children under the age of 12 with some design prints such as Star Wars with sizes available for slightly older children.  In response to popular demand of kids not being able to wear this underwear manufactures such as Old Navy and Gap now market printed briefs to older children.  Following the movie Charlie’s Angel a prototype adult version of the original design of [underoos] was created by Fruit of the Loom and was introduced to their product line, however they were unable to secure a distribution partner to continue into full scale production.  Hanes is currently marketing such underwear as Space designs, [Ninja Turtles], Hulk and Spiderman designed to older children and seem to be continuing their efforts with some success as they are continuing to introduce different designs.
	
	Underoos in general urban format refer to any underwear other then solid color (that is, red, blue, [tightie whities] and so forth), including [boxer briefs] and in some cases boxers that contain cartoon or movie character(s).

	in its essentialy quality of being it is feminine.  
	
	for [simplicity's] sake, we may remind ourselves that we have a brain which has two hemispheres, the left hemisphere [correlated] with the right hand and has to do with rational thought, reason and logic.
	the right hemishpehre correlated with left hand, and has to do with imagination, originality, 'irrational' feelings so on and so forth.
	
	the understanding enables us to add new data to an idea, under a concept, words. and [synthesize] [differnt] elements from differnt ideas and concepts. it is creative.
	reason enables us to analyze, critisize. but the understanding enables us to see immediately when [its enough], to have temperamence and ingenuity, what time , continuous strife and practice in themselves cannot give us.
	it is true, reason is that which makes us differnt from the 'animals' (or our 'lower' nature). but in a way the understanding is that which makes us different from robots.
	
	interestinly enough, the term understanding isn't only used in psychology and philosophy, but in our daily regular and subconscious speech.
		Example: "now i see, now [i understand]"

Unemployment
	(2011-01-21 +96/-27)
	A symptom of the failure and insanity of modern society.
	
	If there is something to do, then how can there be unemployment? There is work to do - we go do it. It's that simple.
	And if there is nothing to do, can't the rich creeps just leave us alone?
	
	No, they can't. Because unemployment was fabricated by the rich cocksuckers in order to keep wages down and keep the lower classes scared and busy. Because if you're afraid you might lose your job - which allows you to purchase tenancy/ food/ clothes from the rich - you keep your mouth shut and you keep working no matter how dumb the job is. And if the wage is shit you keep quiet because at least you're getting some dough with which to pay rent/ alimony/ [student loans]/ dinner.
	
	Meanwhile we see the proliferation of computerization, [robotization], mechanization, miniaturization, and other -zations - meaning there is less and less useful stuff left to do. Most work out there is bullshit. (At least) 70% of us can stop working today (everyone except the people doing real work, who incidentally are the worst paid - the farmers, the janitors, the maintenance workers, the construction workers, etc), and life will go on just fine. Except everyone will have more leisure and less worry.
	
	But we can't have that. Oh no. The rich are just keeping us busy so we fail to notice how they are [getting away with murder].
	
	Unemployment is as dumb as [planned obsolescence]. The future generations will look at us with horror and derision.
		Example: Unemployment has found Joe:
		
		Joe: Shit, I can't find a job.
		Frank: You mean you are a strong, intelligent young person who is willing to work for the benefit of the rich, and they won't even let you do that?

		Frank: How do you fill your days?
		Joe: Well, I don't like fat chicks, and the [hot ones] think I'm a loser, and I don't have enough dough for speed and smack, so I just drink vodka all day and I masturbate to Internet porn.

Unfortunate Acronym
	(2015-05-20 +1465/-123)
	An [unfortunate Acronym] is an acronym for an organisation or person that results in a word that is rude, disgusting or totally inappropriate. A typical example would be the Country and Urban Nature Trail Society which was intended to promote pleasant nature walks in both the town and countryside. It never got off the ground because the acronym was CUNTS. Another British example is Radical Alternatives to Prison, a bunch of bleeding hearts who want to abolish prisons. They were originally going to be called Completely Radical Alternatives to Prison – CRAP, but decided against this, perhaps it was too close to the truth about their ideas.
	One [unfortunate acronym] which is still currently used is TWAT which stands for The War Against Terrorism, while from the United States comes FLOTUS which identifies the President’s wife and stands for First Lady Of The United States. It’s an unfortunate acronym in that it sounds as if it is something unpleasant lurking in a toilet bowl. I suppose they could try removing some of the unimportant letters, but [FLOUS] and FLUS don’t sound much better.
		Example: “Is it true that [Nicola Sturgeon], leader of the [Scottish Nationalist] Party, is going to set up a new organisation, Scottish Nationalists Opposed to Tories?”
		“SNOT! There’s an [unfortunate acronym]!”

	(2007-03-17 +210/-74)
	This is less a definition and more an example of the historical use of the word "unfuck" from my personal experience. True story. The example should be self explanatory but some background is in order. I was probably  one of the youngest sergeants in the [USMC] with almost two years in grade on the 4th of July 1970. I was about halfway through my second tour in Vietnam.  We just returned from an 8-day patrol and had some time off. About ten of us headed down to the  beach where we celebrated the 4th by drinking, smoking, [shooting off] some 300 or so pop [flares], a few thousand rounds of [M-60] [tracer rounds], I made some [firecrackers] from C4 and det chord. Still had one of those left when I noticed our fire out and wood supply depleted. Being the resourceful ranking Marine I used my leadership skills to point out the adjacent [USO] and its ample wood supply. There must have been forty to fifty picnic tables. Huge ones that were made out of some damn fine lumber and they made a damn fine bonfire. We did them all over the next few hours,  four to five added as needed to spark things up. I felt like a real patriot. 
		Example: Hungover, and as ranking member of the [pinic] table assualt team, I was called on the carpet next morning where my CO and [First Shirt] were giving me some 'feedback' on my leadership skills. When I laughed at them accusing me of signalling the enemy, for some reason they got really mad. First Shirt bumps up next to me and with his lips next to my ear he yells,  "You best unfuck your attitude. You can fly with the [nightowl] if you want but you best be ready to scream with the Eagle in the morning." 
		
		True story and just one of many contexts in which the versatile "unfuck" adds value to your formal command of the English language.

Unless you have some super [square wheels], then you should look up the word "Swamp Donkey." Everyone has a unicorn; it's just a matter of spotting her and tracking her down.

	A Unicorn can refer to a man or a woman and is often used to describe [the perfect catch] or perfect partner.

The term is often describing someone who is remarkably attractive (above a [7.9]), but not at all [batshit crazy], amazing at sex, and has a great personality. This definition is used more often to describe this scenario than in reference to LGBT themes. Gay or straight however you can be a Unicorn because you're beautiful, amazing, fuck like a god/goddess, [not crazy] as fuck, awesome to be around and even going somewhere with your life. Hot but down to earth? You may be a Unicorn. People will try to catch [the Unicorn] as if hoping to bring this magical energy in their life but the Unicorn knows only to reveal themselves to the worthy. This makes the encounter all the more magical because it's not a trick of the light it's a mystical mythical magical babe that makes you feel so lucky because you never thought you could find someone amazing as them. Careful, these folks can make the hard of heart easily fall in love.

		Man: Because I met a Unicorn. Her name is [Lindsay].

	Colloquial; Synonym for hot bi babe or [HBB], often derogatory, condescending, or ironic.

	The term is often used to be dismissive of a couple seen to be only superficially polyamorous. Because of the demands that this type of couple places on the woman (that she be single and not take on any additional partners, and become involved with both members of the couple equally, and often "complete" their family as a [surrogate mother] and [housekeeper] and/or [breadwinner] and not do anything that may threaten or disrupt the existing couple), many in [the poly] community call this type of woman a "unicorn", as in mythical and not likely to be found, even though there are plenty of bipoly women around.
	
	Sometimes the unicorn is expected to not develop any emotional attachment and is strictly there for a sexual relationship (equally distributed to both members of the [dyad]) and/or is [prescripted] as a secondary. This term is used as a reminder that bipoly women are people with their own desires, needs, and pre-existing lives, and not fantasy figures or pets. See related prescriptive vs. descriptive.
		Example: John wants a single, attractive woman who will love and have sex equally with him and his wife, but not [interfere] with their marriage, [move in together], help raise their kids but not have any of her own, and not have any other partners.

	A Unicorn can refer to a man or a woman and is often used to describe [the perfect catch] or perfect partner. A Unicorn is a mythical creature, someone amazing who is hard to catch or simply a very rare find. The term is often describing someone who is remarkably attractive (above a [7.9]), but not at all [batshit crazy], amazing at sex, and has a great personality. This definition is used more often to describe this scenario than in reference to LGBT themes. Gay or straight however you can be a Unicorn because you're beautiful, amazing, fuck like a god/goddess, [not crazy] as fuck, awesome to be around and even going somewhere with your life. Hot but down to earth? You may be a Unicorn. People will try to catch [the Unicorn] as if hoping to bring this magical energy in their life but the Unicorn knows only to reveal themselves to the worthy. This makes the encounter all the more magical because it's not a trick of the light it's a mystical mythical magical babe that makes you feel so lucky because you never thought you could find someone amazing as them. Careful, these folks can make the hard of heart easily fall in love.

	Colloquial; Synonym for hot bi babe or [HBB], often derogatory, condescending, or ironic. A bisexual person, usually though not always female, who is willing to join an existing couple, often with the presumption that this person will date and become sexually involved with both members of that couple, and not demand anything or do anything which might cause problems or inconvenience to that couple.
	
	The term is often used to be dismissive of a couple seen to be only superficially polyamorous. Because of the demands that this type of couple places on the woman (that she be single and not take on any additional partners, and become involved with both members of the couple equally, and often "complete" their family as a [surrogate mother] and [housekeeper] and/or [breadwinner] and not do anything that may threaten or disrupt the existing couple), many in [the poly] community call this type of woman a "unicorn", as in mythical and not likely to be found, even though there are plenty of bipoly women around.
	
	Sometimes the unicorn is expected to not develop any emotional attachment and is strictly there for a sexual relationship (equally distributed to both members of the [dyad]) and/or is [prescripted] as a secondary. This term is used as a reminder that bipoly women are people with their own desires, needs, and pre-existing lives, and not fantasy figures or pets. See related prescriptive vs. descriptive.
		Example: John wants a single, attractive woman who will love and have sex equally with him and his wife, but not [interfere] with their marriage, [move in together], help raise their kids but not have any of her own, and not have any other partners.

	(2010-09-09 +11/-8)
	[Unintelligent Design] is the antithesis of, "Intelligent Design" theory.
	
	UD is the affirmation that while a Supreme all knowing (Omniscient), all powerful (Omnipotent), ever present (Omnipresent), higher power created all that exists (Omnigenesis), that when it came to inhabiting the earth with what became/changed to/evolved as homo sapiens (us), it [fucked up big time]!
	
	It created us to be like itself, but stupid. So that we weren't like that Intelligent Designer at all. Then it cursed us as sinners, because the first Mom of us all ate an apple and became smarter than creator dad. And that pissed off dad, who cursed humans for eternity, because [Omniscience] likes to play dirty.
	And then, in an act of second-thought, the designer sent himself to the world he created sinful himself and suffered and died, to lift the curse of sin he bestowed himself. So that those who believed that was love, would be saved from himself.
	So once dead, human souls could leave the [unintelligent design] they'd been living in and move in with the designer of that debacle, for eternity! Think of the fun! Think of the amount of [Rubik's] cubes laying around to be played with. Think of all those virgins getting [deflowered] by pasted together formerly exploded meaty pieces, from that other unintelligently designed neighborhood. If the designer fucked up making a garden paradise, think of how perfect heaven stands a chance of being.
	
	Atheism, anyone!?
	
	Ahwoman!
		Example: "I'm a natural [born sinner], by [unintelligent design]."
		
		Salvation is a method of [saving the world] from god, so he can be excused from unintelligently designing the world to be sinful and in need of saving from himself.
		
		God is god by unintelligent design
		
		I think, therefore I beat the odds of unintelligent design.
		
		Jesus saves me from reality, by design.

Union Beach
	(2005-06-27 +78/-73)
	a little town off of the edge of [Keyport] no one kinda never heard of......it is full of [hoods] and poor people. It is one square mile, and has only one elementary school (k-8) and no high school. It also has a fun [little beach] but you can't really swim in the water because you will not get the odor out of your body for weeks. But, overall, it kinda sucks
		Example: An example of Union Beach is the [poor] [version] of [Hazlet]

	(2013-01-23 +16/-18)
	Union Beach is comprised of the remains of what little dignity [Keyport] had, [washed up] on a dirty, needle-ridden shore. It is a smelly town, named after its "beach," that is, instead, a patch of second-hand sand and an arrangement of fake [dolphins]. Pre-Hurricane Sandy Union Beach (PHSUB) was a dump, and Post-Hurricane Sandy Union Beach (also PHSUB) continues to be a dump. Children grown here are misshapen and unintelligent. They go on to lead unsuccessful lives and swim in the filthy, green water that stunts their growth on a daily basis.
		Example: Person 1: "There's a party in Union Beach tonight. [Would you like to] go?"
		Person 2: "Union Beach? I always [regret] going there. But, hey, a party is a party... and at least it isn't [Keansburg]!"

Union City
	(2005-08-27 +106/-37)
	Union City is a [congested], gritty, industrial small city in North Jersey.  It has a lot of New York City influence since it is just less than five minutes away from Manhattan. Union City is rather impoverished but it has always been a destination for immigrants. It is the [Little Havana] of New Jersey, better the Hispanic capital of the state.  The Hispanic population is very [diversified] with Cubans on the top.  It features Bergenline Avenue, the chief commercial thoroughfare and a gateway to Latin America. UC is sometimes crime ridden but other than that it's ok.
		Example: Whenever I want Cuban cigars, authentic Cuban, [Ecuadorian] or [Colombian] food, or just want to chill in a cool town I just head up to Union City.
		
		[Viva] Union City!

	(2004-09-02 +70/-54)
	An industrial city in NE New Jersey. It is more like a small town with a [mirrored] image of New York City. It has the highest Hispanic percentage in the state with [Cubans] owning everything (supermarkets, restaurants, stores, etc.). It has more Cubans per square mile than Miami or even [Havana]. There are other Hispanics as well like the Dominicans, Salvadorans, and Ecuadorians but they are still the minority since they don't have much power or ownership. Most businesses (even Chinese restaurants) have signs in Spanish since many do not know English. The kids are mainly [spiggas] or hot Latinas though there are some rockers.
		Example: Ah, the smell of Cuban food, the not too frequent gangs, old men with [guayabera] shirts, an abundant supply of [Materva], cigar factories, Spanish spoken everywhere, [Celia] Cruz Way, the skyline of Manhattan, Bergenline (pronounced Bergelain by locals) and the ghetto downtown...I love Union City.

	(2006-08-11 +106/-45)
	The most densely-populated city in the U.S., sandwiched-in between New York City and [Jersey City]. Once inhabited mainly by [Cubans], it is now home to Latino immigrants from all countries. The only place you can have an authentic [Cuban sandwich] east of Miami. 
		Example: [Union City] is the "[Little Apple]."
		
		Niggas from [Jersey City] or Newark are afraid to go into Union City. It's that crazy.

union trash
	(2007-04-22 +63/-34)
	[Union trash] is a union member 1. who thinks they know everything, 2. who thinks they are entitled to everything, 3. who expects a pay raise and more benefits every year but don't necessarily work any harder just because they paid their [dues], 4. they are often egomaniacs, lacks common sense, bureaucratic, loud, obnoxious and [malcontents], and 5. one or any combination of the above. These people are difficult to get rid of in the workplace.
		Example: 1. No wonder Toyota, WalMart, and Southwest ([non-union] companies) are beating their competitions, (GM, Ford, [Chrysler], Albertson's, [Safeway], American, United) they don't have any union trash in their ranks.
		
		2. Next time your job goes overseas, blame the union trash. They increase the costs of doing business here in the United States.

	(2007-10-25 +36/-23)
	These are the people who always think they are doing [a great job] even though they're just mediocre at their job, or even worse, very lousy at their job, and they think that they are entitled to [a pay] raise every month and more benefits every year, just because they pay their union [dues].
		Example: [Union trash] are the reason for [the decline] of the manufacturing industry in the United States. GM (union company) is planning to cut jobs in the United states. Toyota ([non-union] company) is planning to open a new plant in Tennessee.

Union College
	(2010-08-29 +111/-25)
	The reality of Union College is a mix of the above stories. Lots of rich folks but some middle class. Crazy partying, lots of drinking, coke is not in short supply but not everyone does it. It's a 4 night a week party, Monday booze where you live, Wednesday bars & small parties, Weekends [Frats], house parties, bars everything. Mad [fratty] but [frats] def aren't the only game in town.
	Lots of nerdy people but certainly the coolest, [bacchanalian] nerds to walk the earth.
	
	The campus is gorgeous especially in Autumn and Spring and tho the snow is pretty too but gets old real fast.
	[Schenectady] is a dump but a dump with character.
	Certainly live for brunch @ West
	No shortage of preppyness but a variety of styles are on showcase - Impeccable Style
	The Place Exudes Class & Tradition
	For those who have a problem with Union, Union doesn't care so keep it yourself
	Work hard and play harder is the Union Motto
	NUFF SAID
		Example: Union College, [party]

	(2012-08-10 +39/-9)
	Union is an amazing school- academically, athletically, and socially!
	
	Our engineering program is top notch- everyone is incredibly intelligent and works hard. We also have fantastic psychology and [political science] departments (although all departments are pretty strong). Most students complete a thesis and many are published before graduation- which is a huge deal for [undergrads].
	
	Union was a [party school] in the early 2000s when drugs and frats reigned supreme- but things are changing. We still have a very active Greek life- and everyone loves a great party- but the stereotypes of blondes with pearls and [douche's] with bmw's don't apply anymore. Yes, we are ranked the #5 party school in the nation, but that doesn't do us justice. We do so much more than have a good time on the weekends. We were also ranked the #11 most beautiful school- the campus is gorgeous and the men and women aren't shabby either. We may be hot, but we're not shallow. We all hit the gym (or at least look like we do) but we also occasionally wear sweatpants to class.
	
	Our Hockey Team is D1 and absolutely fantastic! Last year we were ranked #4 in the nation. We consistently beat out Harvard, Yale, Brown, and [Dartmouth] and going to a [home game] is one of the best experiences. Our [D3] teams are also fantastic.
	
	We may be smart, have money, and win championships but we don't need to try too hard because we know who we are. We're Union. We're the best.
		Example: High school senior: I read on urban dictionary that [Union] College is just a [fratty] [party school] for rich white kids.
		
		[UNION] STUDENT: It isn't 2006 anymore. Union is great, yes we know how to party (but what college kid doesn't?) but we're also smart, talented, and athletic!
		
		High school senior: Oh, maybe I should check it out then.
		
		UNION STUDENT: Absolutely!

	(2008-03-27 +220/-82)
	 First of all, the things listed above are old school. You want the real deal, check this out. Union is in [Schenectady]: heart of NY. We're not from the City, and we're not on the Canadian border, we're basically perfectly located. The campus is gorgeous in all seasons, small and [walkable], and the buildings are beautiful. 
	 The people here are kick-ass: brains, beauty and [brawn]. Not everyone is preppy, not everyone is rich. The kids are varied and down to earth, accessible and personable. It's easy to meet people from various backgrounds and we're not just a bunch of clones. Yeah, we've got some Coach and Armani, but no one's scared to rock some Target fashions. Also, we're not defined by our [Greek life]. The sorority girls aren't a bunch of blonde coke-heads, and our frat brothers are not roofying maniacs. 
	 This IS the real Union College.     
		Example: Mechanical engineering, Minnesota, [Delta Delta Delta] sister
		East Asian Studies, [Voorheesville], NY, Ballroom Dancer
		Environmental Studies, Texas, [Alpha Epsilon Pi] brother
		English and Art, Maine, Minerva House Council
		Spanish and Economics, Schenectady, Volleyball
		
		All here at Union College... 

	(2009-12-19 +83/-73)
	Union is a school for the elite who like to get trashed. Just because we're not an Ivy, dont think for a second that were not smarter than you... because we are. We also party harder than you. We kill kegs in [frats], get blacked out in bars, and destroy dorm buildings. Greek life rules the school. We go to frats on weekends and bars on Wednesdays. We're the #13 party school in the nation and proud of it. We drive foreign whips (and im not talkin about toyotas) and blow a ton of money on drugs and alcohol every week. We maintain 90% of [Schenectady's] economy, concider it [charity work] - your welcome. We go to class just to kill time, and we know deep down everyone wishes they were more like us
		Example: Union College is so [fratty], and they got so [much] [steez]!

	(2006-09-17 +75/-231)
	A beautiful campus, but it's everybody's [second choice].  Maybe it's not a "new ivy" but it sure as hell is a [hidden gem].  People here love to party and dance.  Security is lax, and waves as people walk by holding alcohol.  We are preppy and everybody has something designer. From shoes to purses, to sunglasses: armani and coach aren't in short supply.  The guys here are crazy and pretty sketchy, almost every frat is known for roofying girls.  The sororities are full of cocaine and all the girls are blonde and beautiful.  We are the real thing, we are better than orange county because everyone is [old money] here.  Fuck your beaches and surfing, we've got [Galas] and heritage.  We hate the town we live in because it's trashy and rundown...it used to be amazing before everything fell to hell.  This school has been here forever and it's not going anywhere, so get used to it.
		Example: You're [wearing sweatpants] and you're at Union College? ([What a] [trashy whore])

	(2005-01-17 +456/-408)
	we are rich. we are preppy. we are better than you. we pop our collars.  we wear uggs, loafers, and pointy shoes. burberry scarves and designer bags are a must. if you don't have a north face fleece and a [nalgene], go home.  [butt pants] are so hot. we have a lot of money and we spend it on alcohol and coke (and we don't mean the soda).  weekends are for gettin drunk, going to [frats] and bars, [hookin] up with random hotties and sleeping it off. brunch at west is what we live for, but we certainly don't go until 12. we are white and we hate 'doids. we live for our cell phones and for aim. don't talk to us if you are not one of us.
		Example: we are [soooo] [better than you].

	(2008-01-16 +38/-283)
	[Union College] is not what you think it is. The school is completely full of nerds, who by the way, are UGLY! There isn't one pretty girl or one good looking guy. Yeah, they may have money, but they obviously aren't using it the right way. They may have designer [duds], but they look like they got dressed blind. Union kids go pretty crazy on the weekend but it's not like it's much fun! Everyone goes to the same bar, Gepettos, which is [complete TRASH], Followed by a fraternity party. If you ask me, this school is LAME!

	A small, private [liberal arts college] in the [Napa] Valley with around 1,500 students. Known for its 100% acceptance rate into [Loma] Linda University, and its prestigious reputation in academics, leading to its high rankings by U.S. News and World Report.
	
	The students here are generally very motivated, and the ladies are very attractive. A high percentage of girls here are sluts who can be banged quite easily. There are lots of asians, latinos and whites. Not so many blacks.
		Example: I met [this girl] in at [the bar], she was really hot, but wouldn't say much. After we finally got talking, we went and had [the night] of our lives! She went to Pacific Union College.

	(2005-10-13 +18/-38)
	Crappy school of "higher" education which blocks [www.urbandictionary.com].  This school is better [suited] for billygoats in [clown shoes] than human beings.

Union, NJ
	(2006-12-07 +56/-24)
	[Union's] esteem relies heavily on it's claim to the "World's Tallest Water Sphere." It has one high school, which houses about 2500 students per year. Union [High's] reputation relies heavily on having past graduates such as [Ray Liotta], Robert Wuhl, and (almost) Artie Lang. If you live in Union you probably never go to "the center," or actually hang out in Union all that much at all. If you're not from Union and you visit frequently you mostly likely have a condition, and should get that checked out.
		Example: [Oh boy], I can't [wait] [to leave] Union, NJ!

	Got a problem with a work collegue who is putting shit on the merrits of [unions] all the time?
	Don't fear, you can just call up your local unionist-thug and he or she will straighten things out.
	
	They will cause the bastard to be ostrasised from other employees. They [will read] the assholes emails to management to see what's going on, and they will spread roumors about that shit being an [Amway] person or a Scientilogist.
	Best of all, they will try and get them fired!
		Example: Steve was being a [unionist thug] when he tried to get Mike fired. And when he accused Mike of being a pedophile, a rapist, and some kind of get-rich-quick [scam artist].
		[Steves] job was eventually done, and he was very happy with himself.

unions suck
	(2006-10-28 +59/-48)
	[Unions] make it so their members are overpaid. Especially the [unions] that represent the NBA, NFL, NHL, and [Major League Baseball]. 
		Example: [Unions suck], because people like Alex Rodriquez ([A-Rod]) make $25 [million] a year. That makes it more expensive to go to games for all of us.

Unions
	(2011-07-10 +1444/-190)
	n. One of the many scapegoats utilized by the GOP and other ignorant people to blame societal woes upon, namely a poor economy.
	
	What these ignorant people do not understand is that [unions] are a major backbone of the United States' labor force.
	
	According to the US [Bureau of Labor Statistics], over 1 out of every 10 salary/wage earners is a [unionized] worker in America. This is not an insignificant statistic.
	
	Workers need unions as much as ever—because most corporations focus on profit at the expense of employees. Employers are constantly trying to shed responsibilities— providing health insurance, good pension coverage, reasonable work hours and job safety protections, for example—while making workers' jobs and incomes less secure through [downsizing], part-timing and contracting out. Working people need a voice at work to keep employers from making our jobs look like they did 100 years ago, with sweatshop conditions, unlivable wages and 70-hour workweeks.
	
	[Unions] are a pivotal part of the American labor force. The only people that hate them are those who do not belong to one and are too lazy and/or afraid to join one (out of fear of their employer, who doesn't want to stop lining his pockets by taking a decrease in profits). So instead of campaigning for them, these [ignoramuses] fight against them.
	
	Go figure.
		Example: Person 1: Hey Person 2, you work in [the Electrical] Workers Union, correct? It's people like you that are ruining our economy and destroying [the foundation] of America.
		
		Person 2: Well if you consider earning a livable wage to provide for my family, living within my means, working under proper non-sweatshop conditions, acquiring a [pension] that I can survive off of when I retire, and not being afraid of getting bullied by my boss destroying the foundation of America, then call me a terrorist. Unions are terrible, aren't they?

	[How to] tell chemists from non-chemists apart, [Read aloud] [the following] word:

	(2005-07-09 +31/-8)
	Another name [synonymous] with [America] or [the United States].
		Example: The Union is comprised of over 280 [million] [people] and [50 states].

	(2009-01-15 +1362/-838)
	A group of workers coming together and demanding the right to collectively bargain with their employer (contract).  Some like to think that [unions] are no longer relevant in this vibrant economy and that corporations are inherently good things that are good for workers.  Yea?  Well, [rest assured] that while you are trying to figure out how to pay that credit card bill this month that is slowly killing you, the boss does not have your problem.  Oh yea, the work harder argument.  Well, [the folks] that work the HARDEST in America earn the least.  [Unions] are YOUR way out of having to ball lap your boss at work for a decent wage.  You can make him negotiate a contract with you, you just have to join a UNION!
		Example: I am working my face off and I have not received a [raise] in about two fucking years.  If I ask my boss for a raise he might laugh at me or worse.  I guess I should talk to the rest of my miserable co-workers, join a [union], and make this prick treat me with some [dignity].  

	(2005-03-13 +1350/-879)
	Group of workers who work together for eachother.  A certant percentage is taken out of the paycheck in order for it to work effectively.  Before [unions] some people had to work [84] hour workweeks in [dangerous minds], going to work in the dark and waking up in the dark 6 days a week; and by the end of the week owing the company money.
		Example: It was [more like] [slavery] than [employment]

	(2007-06-05 +1345/-885)
	Also known as Trade Union or Labour Union. 
	
	Workers [bind] together to form [Unions] so that they together can fight for better work conditions. Without the power of the Union workers would completely be at the mercy of the employers. But [sticking together] they got a better change to fight for their interests. 
		Example: Thanks to the [Unions] [we got] a 40 [hour] work week.

	(2003-04-03 +1347/-908)
	the only chance that you have at work! to get a [fair shake]! the only [true friend] that you can trust at [the work] place!
		Example: Because my [work] [place] doesn't have a union, I [take it in the ass]!

	(2003-12-17 +1352/-936)
	The only thing that gives [the working man] a half descent chance at surviving in America. Rich fucking republican pukes hate [Unions] because they fucking regulate their greedy asses from ripping honest working people off.  Unions are also kind of [hipocritical] in a way seeing as whenever a Union goes on strike, the strikers only get paid $5 an hour why the heads/owners of the [unions] make a shit load of money.  Unions however are still better to have than not to have, so go fucking shove it you fat, lazy, republican pukes.
		Example: "FUCK THIS! I'M ON [MY LUNCH] BRAKE YOU [FUCKING ASSHOLE]! *whips out [union card]*

Uniontown
	(2005-05-04 +128/-88)
	[County seat] of [Fayette County], PA that's full of redneck losers who should move to Arkansas- hey, dumbasses, the name of the town is [UNIONtown], not Confederate town.
		Example: Uniontown is so [insignificant] that people in [Pittsburgh] [don't know] where it is.

	(2011-11-12 +30/-25)
	A [historical] city located outside of [Pittsburgh], PA that has its share of beauty, but is misunderstood and stereotyped among many. Includes the nicest/best group of people found in [Fayette County], and should no longer be viewed only by its negative flaws, but by its positive existence.
		Example: Man, what an [amazing] [place] that [city] of Uniontown is!!!

	(2011-12-19 +20/-4)
	A City in NorthEast Ohio of about 25,000 people situated in between [North Canton] and [Hartville, Ohio].
	
	Still in Stark County when it was being over developed with shopping malls, people began to develop [Uniontown] in the late 1980's. Full of pretty nice people, cows, poultry, cornfields, planned housing developments, and one of the most well hidden radioactive and chemical landfills of the 20th century.
	
	The [IEL] Landfill there is leaking South West at the rate of about 3 miles per year underground since 1972, when the barriers broke open, and the leachate entered the well water.
	
	Nobody in [UnionTown] wants to talk about the landfill anymore, but just try to buy a lot in Uniontown and see how quick you have to sign the disclosure forms are displayed. People there are either ignorant about the fact they are living on top of 1750 tons of chlorinated hydrocarbons and radium waste, or they just want it to go away and not have it mentioned anywhere online, or in public record so that their property values in the market don't tank.
		Example: Did you every hear of [that place] called [Love Canal]? Yeah, that place is [a a] real UnionTown, Ohio.

Unionville high school
	(2005-05-02 +173/-70)
	[white].... [thats] all i [have to] say
		Example: about [98]% of uville is [white]

	(2004-12-20 +173/-96)
	One of the smartest schools in the state of Pennsylvania...Not everyone smokes up and gets wasted each weekend,every high school has kids like that. It is just a accustion [Kennett] makes because [mushrooms] are the only things it has [going for it].
		Example: [Unionville High School] may have its share of [daddy's girl] sluts and [Hummers] parked in the school parking lot, but it also have the highest test scores in our state, and about 97% of the school goes to college.

	(2004-12-30 +68/-102)
	Navigating the hallways of one of the richest schools in Pennsylvania you come across [the girls that are] "popular" participating in the Bulimia Olympics, but not without carrying their Louis Vuitton bags and wearing the latest from Abercrombie & Fitch with the "thong of the week" from Victoria Secret. Once you get your eyes rolled at a few times and a few dirty looks from the sluts--I mean girls, you come across the other half. If you aren't wearing pants 12 sizes too big along with your ice 'round your neck and a joint in your pocket, you aint cool. Everyone belongs to the Ghetto, or wish they did, as they trip over themselves tryin to rap their way down the hall. Gotta have had sex or gotten drunk or you're just [plain weird], and if you have something to do, you are in the minority, but whites definately aren't. [Unionville] is the ghetto meets Beverly Hills.
		Example: You know you're in [Unionville] when...
		
		every kid has rap blaring out of their oversized headphones
		
		a guy can wear baggy jeans and a [Dr.J] jersey [and the next day] wear a shirt and tie, but still be fashionably correct

	(2005-01-10 +130/-71)
	The opposite of [Kennett] aka smart, rich, white kids who have their own cars and plan on going to expensive colleges in VA and the Northeast.  You can count the # of minority kids on one hand, and you'd need about [67] hands to count the # of expensive-ass cars in the parking lot. But the girls are pretty, the student body actually is intelligent, and the rivalry between Kennett and [Unionville] is probably the strongest of any two high schools.
		Example: A [little] [too much] like [the Main Line].

	(2005-01-10 +62/-55)
	[Simply] [put]... [the U].
		Example: [Example] not [necessary]...

	(2013-08-20 +14/-12)
	High school in Pennsylvania widely known for its incredible theater department, as well as its rigorous academics. We also have a kick-ass marching band, and our music department boasts some of the most hardworking and talented kids around. In other words... We're not all snobby, slutty, jock-ish, popular jerks. This school is dominated by [drama geeks], computer nerds, science prodigies, and art students. Sure, there are kids that fit the [Unionville] stereotype, but they're [outnumbered] by future Broadway stars and nuclear physicists.
		Example: The phrase "Unionville High School" has been [officially] declared synonymous with "[Cappie] [Magnet]."

unipooper

		Example: "Dude, have they [caught] the unipooper [yet]?"
		
		"The unipooper [strikes] again!"

_____

uniporn
	(2010-01-26 +63/-15)
	When a guy or a girl puts a [strap on] [dildo] on their [forehead] and fucks somebody with it.
	
	Used as verb and noun.
		Example: A: "[I had] the best [night] ever"
		B: "Wow, what [happened]?"
		A: "I got uniporned!"

	(2004-07-10 +84/-26)
	When [unicorns]... [um]... do it. And by do it, [I mean fuck].
		Example: That [nasty] [furry] probably thinks about [uniporn] all day...

	(2009-03-02 +25/-10)
	(1) The [HxC] way of saying [Unicorn].
	
	(2) Unicorn [intercourse].
		Example: (1)
		
		Shannon: Let's [ride on] our Uniporn into the sunset, bbeh.
		
		Kurukuru: kdrivebish.
		
		(2)
		
		[Unicorn] #1: Charrrlieeee, [candy mountain]!
		
		Charlie: Let's have sex.

Uniquality
	(2017-04-17 +156/-16)
	Most use this word to describe someone or something as being one in a million. Well this can be true but unique is someone you won't see wasting time at [the end of the rainbow] you'll see her [riding the rainbow]. Unique doesn't just come as a word but it comes as an action. She does what others are to afraid to do. She puts her [friends first] not herself looks for the good in others when they can't find it themselves. She's willing to do the extreme to be different than others. Shes funny you will never find anyone like like the unique.
		Example: Being [one of a kind]
		
		Someone [going left] when everyone else is going right.
		Being different from [the rest].
		
		Person 1: She's so unique
		
		Person 2: She is she's so special one of a kind

	(2015-05-17 +142/-25)
	One of a kind meaning special.....she could be gorgeous in her own way she makes people want to like her by her personality if she has a bf she's [gifted] because that means her boyfriend finds her special even if she doesn't have all [perfections]. She's athletic,pretty,funny and not afraid to [confront] people.. Unique defines one of a kind.
		Example: [My name is] unique, [your name] is very unique! Because [your one] of a kind

	(2010-08-08 +80/-13)
	different, [or not] [like everyone] else. not following [the group]
		Example: [Unique] people are those who have many [weird] qualities but [execute] them well

	(2003-09-21 +448/-142)
	Doing or [believing] in [different] [things] than most.
		Example: [Sarah] is [unique].

	(2006-03-14 +843/-319)
	Unique isn’t [just a word] that teachers tell their “special” students they are, its means being different in usually a good a way, unlike the rest of the common world. It is when everyone wears white and one person wears purple. Someone’s unique way of talking. I hate how most people define this world like, [Mr. Rodgers] is trying to comfort you. Being unique is [a good thing], most of the time anyway.
		Example: Her [feather] [hat] was unique.

	(2008-06-09 +345/-141)
	Something very hard to find these days...TOO MANY DAMN FOLLOWERS OUT THERE. Why can`t people just keep it real!? Who cares if someone wears stuff that [isn]`t in style.  Is it just me, or is EVERY girl`s favorite color: pink?? 
	 
	People do/wear/what you like. Not because [everyone else does]/wears it. BE [YUU]<3
		Example: FOLLOWER: " omg i should buy that, its [IN STYLE]!
		UNIQUE: " WHY?!:S its fucking ugly
		FOLLOWER:  But if I don't, I'll be a total [lozer]!! BESIDES EVERYONE ELSE HAS IT!

	[IMO] nobody is unique. Every [aspect] of a person can be found in another. So perhaps the combination of [the parts] that make up a person can be unique, but not those parts.

Unique Reject
	(2005-05-16 +53/-32)
	A Unique Reject is a lesser know [subculture] that is relitivly new. If you are a Unique Reject, you are just basically out to have a good time. You will run around screaming random things, socializing with random people, do things that are unexpected and not on purpose. You can't become a Unique Reject... you just are one. This is the worst subculture to be in because its easy to spot the posers. Most people in this subculture are called odd or weird. A Unique Reject has friends that are in many different subcultures and you don't hate someone elses subculture, you will just stick of for yourself. You aren't a hot topic [shopper] because you are not a poser. People may also call you goth occasionally. You mainly [wear black] shirts with movies titles, pictures, band names, or [random words] on it. You also mainly wear jeans that might have been drawn on with pen or makers. You are very different than others and you don't try to be. You can easily [just be yourself] and you don't care what others think, which is pretty difficult to do. You wear eyeliner and nothing else. You are rather simple and where 1 necklace and some bracelets on your arm because with out them you feel naked.
		Example: The person [running around] screaming 'fuck the [llamas]!' is a [unique reject].

Well this can be true but unique is someone you won't see wasting time at [the end of the rainbow] you'll see her [riding the rainbow]. Unique doesn't just come as a word but it comes as an action. She does what others are to afraid to do. She puts her [friends first] not herself looks for the good in others when they can't find it themselves. She's willing to do the extreme to be different than others. Shes funny you will never find anyone like like the unique.
		Example: Being [one of a kind]
		
		Someone [going left] when everyone else is going right.
		Being different from [the rest].
		
		Person 1: She's so unique

	Unique isn’t [just a word] that teachers tell their “special” students they are, its means being different in usually a good a way, unlike the rest of the common world. It is when everyone wears white and one person wears purple. Someone’s unique way of talking. I hate how most people define this world like, [Mr. Rodgers] is trying to comfort you. Being unique is [a good thing], most of the time anyway.
		Example: Her [feather] [hat] was unique.

Unique Reject
	(2005-05-16 +53/-32)
	A Unique Reject is a lesser know [subculture] that is relitivly new. If you are a Unique Reject, you are just basically out to have a good time. You will run around screaming random things, socializing with random people, do things that are unexpected and not on purpose. You can't become a Unique Reject... you just are one. This is the worst subculture to be in because its easy to spot the posers. Most people in this subculture are called odd or weird. A Unique Reject has friends that are in many different subcultures and you don't hate someone elses subculture, you will just stick of for yourself. You aren't a hot topic [shopper] because you are not a poser. People may also call you goth occasionally. You mainly [wear black] shirts with movies titles, pictures, band names, or [random words] on it. You also mainly wear jeans that might have been drawn on with pen or makers. You are very different than others and you don't try to be. You can easily [just be yourself] and you don't care what others think, which is pretty difficult to do. You wear eyeliner and nothing else. You are rather simple and where 1 necklace and some bracelets on your arm because with out them you feel naked.
		Example: The person [running around] screaming 'fuck the [llamas]!' is a [unique reject].

UniRock
	(2020-03-01 +133/-11)
	UniRock Stands for "U And I Rock"
	
	When a person calls themselves a UniRock they understand that "U" comes before "I" and that their community is as important as themselves. The community is like family to the UniRock, often calling themselves [UniFam] and work together with the UniRock to create great social media content.
	
	Behind every UniRock is a [UniRach] who understand the UniRock and compliments them in all they do. Without the UniRach, the UniRock would not have the time to be a great creator of content for the world to see.
	
	A UniRock creates great commentary and [investigative] videos, updating them with followup videos and, when needed, releasing a final tell all video once all the facts have been found out.
	
	Often the detractors will misrepresent a [UniRock's] commentary and investigations for drama and [debunking] without realizing it is an ongoing process. Unknown to them the UniRock, with UniRach and UniFam will continue investigating, [probing], until the truth is found.
	
	A UniRock is often characterised as a person who exposes [McRae] Boomers and frauds while laughing at them for being ding dong dumdums
	
	And finally a UniRock plays combat games while doing enjoyable multiple hour streams.
		Example: Boy UniRock does long streams playing that [Tarkov] game, but the commentary he comes out with is so enjoyable the hours fly by.
		
		The [McRae Boomer's] biggest mistake was trying to use the UniRock to continue his vendetta because the UniRock was only fooled a short time and called out the evil ways of the [McRae Boomer].

unisa
	(2007-10-31 +196/-22)
	[UNISA] is an abbreviation for the "university" of South Australia.
	
	The unveristy was founded in 1992 after the South Australian School of Dark Arts merged with 4 centrelinks and received misfuded ATSIC money and 300 [hectares] of land including the 100 acre wood and the gummi bear forest.
	
	[Unisa] is well known for the highest rate of student dissatisfaction and suicide. Unfortunately it missed out by 1 place in [the Australia's] Worst rated University title in 2005.
	
	However new management techniques that include harassment, black mail, neglect and violence have ensured that UNISA will reach its position of worst uni. Heights are set to be the worst university in the Asia pacific and even the world!
	
	The university ([S.A's] biggest) is compromised of 40 000 Students. 36 000 students are from overseas and are primarily at UNISA to get permanent residence. the 4000 other students are locals who missed out on getting in to proper Uni's.

	2. A Megadeth song
	
	(1) United Abominations is the 11th studio album from heavy metal group Megadeth. United Abominations is conisdered the best album of 2007. It is truly a masterpiece already has some legendary songs. The songs in the album are heavy, fast, and [thrashy]. The album also contained a remake of "A Tout Le Mode" with "A Tout Le Mode (Set Me Free)" which featured Lacuna Coil singer (and sexy) [Cristina Scabbia].

	The best songs are 
	
	"Washington Is Next!"

	"United Abominations" 
	"Play For Blood" 
	"Sleepwalkers"
	"À Tout le Monde (Set Me Free)"
	"Never Walk Alone... A [Call To Arms]"
	
	Despite the greatness of the band, the radio, Grammy's, and mainstream America ignored the album and Megadeth once again. They (media) instead publicized Paramore (singer needs a dynamite in her mouth to go boom), Jimmy Eat World (Jimmy! Eat bullets!), My Crappy Romance (Lack Parade sucked), Kelly Clarkson (overated), Carrie Underwood (Before she sings), Taking Lack Sunday, Avril Lavigne (needs to shut her mouth), and [Foul Out] Boy.

	So, the United Kingdom is [Great Britain] ( England, Scotland, Wales) and Northern Ireland.
		Example: The proper name for the [UK] is ' The United Kingdom of [Great Britain] and [Northern] Ireland'

If any of the people who insult britain ever got off their asses and bothered to visit the country that [civilised] them. Fuck you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
		Example: American: [Howdy] you stoopid son of a bitch
		
		[British person]:[Greetings], fat fucktard who has ancestors from the United Kingdom.
		
		American:whuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu?

	(2010-12-23 +56/-64)
	A bit of an [misleader] as it is neither United nor a Kingdom. The English hate the Scots and the Scots hate the English - So much for unity. The current monarch is [QUEEN Elizabeth], hence we should rename it "The Un-united [Queendom]".
		Example: You live in the United Kingdom? Isn't that full of [chavs] and [idiots]?
		No... [Mumford and Sons] are not chavs!

	The nation that once ruled half the globe ([British Empire]). Was known to treat it's colonies as if they were shite at times (sent their youth to die in two world wars and [Boer War]) and very well in others. (Defence, trade) wiped it's colonies noses, asses, and so on. Has a long history of bad treatment of the Irish over a period of 800 years. Should be proud of teaching Canada and other dominions all of their traditions such as democracy, [free speech], and should also be ashamed of their degrading treatment of the Irish. 
	
		Example: The United Kingdom is a paradox, it has been a role model, and a human rights [abuser], where [do it's] dominions get some of their [bad habits] from?

United Nations
	(2019-03-14 +193/-10)
	A pathetic international organization that focuses more on preventing [Max Barry] from using their name in [NationStates] than stopping [genocides], civil wars, and conflicts. The concept of it sounds great on paper, just like communism and a War on Drugs, but like those two things, they don't work IRL. They seriously need to step up their game and actually unite the world. At most, they send food to countries and maybe build a few buildings there, which is just slapping a band-aid on a guy who just lost their arms. They need to get peacekeepers in there and turn the country into Utopia by giving them the stuff needed to grow food.
		Example: Reporter: How successful was [the United Nations] at stopping the genocide against your people?
		Victim: They stood there while my kids were being shot by [insurgents]. [The United Nations] is a pathetic, useless organization.

	(2010-06-01 +63/-8)
	1. [a wet noodle].

	(2005-01-11 +209/-92)
	A group of nations whose purpose is increasingly [irrelevant]; whose [widespread] [corruption] is now coming to light.
		Example: The [corruption] of [the United Nations] is growing unchecked. Can't wait 'till [Annan] tries to explain the "Oil-for-Food" program.

	(2005-01-02 +455/-244)
	[please] [see] "[retarded]"
		Example: [The United Nations] wants to [control] [the entire world].

	(2004-09-19 +176/-107)
	An all-knowing, all-seeing organization which in allowed Iraq to ship all of their biological and chemical [WMDs] to Syria by having Charter members Russia and France drag their feet in refusing to [ratify] [unilateral] military action under the obvious guise of "diplomatic negotiations" AKA Food for Oil program
	Then after the United States and ITS ALLIES proceeded to enforce 1441, they cried foul, blood for oil, etc. And for the icing on this cake, the UN secretary  general now says that the U.S. engaged in a totally illegal military action.
		Example: United Nations? Not [since] [WWII] [my friends]!

	(2004-11-22 +105/-74)
	[A tool] of [the devil] if [ever] their was one.

	United Nations - United European States - United States Of America - Soviet Union - The Thousand Years [Reich] - The [Holy Roman Empire]... See the tendency? The beloved dream of the power-hungry people from all times and places to rule the world by totalitarian [despotism] and genocide choking [human dignity] and free spirit to death. But this dream remains hidden or not understood by the majority of people thats why this dream comes iteratively into reality and take the sleeping [sheeple] by surprise. And now I guess you think that with [the Hitler's] Reich defeated and the Soviet Union collapsed that [dream's] [kaput]? No, you are wrong you notgivingaflyingfuckaboutwhatiswronfgwiththisworld bastards.The [New World Order] (The Good Ol' Order) is the new (good ol') kid on the block being pushed through behind the mask of benevolent organizations and activities like the UN and its organisations, the [World Bank], the World Trade Organisation and many others this being the oldest trick of these really evil people thats why while you drink your Coca-Cola and watch MTV and think how beautiful it is all, thanking the Capitalism and the system that sustains it, the world is being more chaotic every day, the poverty and deprivation deepening, people suffering and dying and these control freaks would once again offer the good ol' solution - a one world government with a one [world bank] and a chip stuck in [your already fucked] up body to rule over you and the planet - a global fascisto-communist state wich is actually a [godless] capitalism pushed to its logical limits i.e. a global scale imperialism. But, you know... this new (good ol') ideology really needs an enemy to justifies itself before the sheeple and guess what - its another global ideology of course and this time it is the Islam, the previous being the Communism. The times we are living in are really the biblical endtimes and this time it ain't a joke this time you better listen. The planet is globalised by the science and technology, many choices were made of how and according to which principle to live - individualistic or collectivistic, spiritual or material, but never been the two or the four together due to the ignorance of the sheeple and their master-sheeperds.In [these times] the spiritual nature of the sheeple would be reinstated again by its divine root i.e. by God and they will wake up, their spiritual eyes will open and they will see the global lie.[The sad thing] though is that many of the anti-N.[W.O]. people are extremists of some sort some of them being anti-semitic, others white-supremacists, others just plain racists, others aggressively [atheistic], others just being there out of anger or fear for their welfare, others literally fundamentalistic of their religion - these people are not actually awaken for this coming global fascist state they are just being the same [supid] sheeple that constitute the very same New World Order they are fighting against.Only through caring and loving spiritual nature people could understand the reality behind this N.W.O.
	And ultimately this N.W.O. is not the actual enemy, the real enemy is within us and this evil ideology has always been made by the people through their lack of spiritual awareness and ego-pride trips throughout their whole lives these ever new world orders being the logical and spiritual consequence of this.An [in-your-face] real "what goes around, comes around" situation.
	So be prepared, don't live in fear but free your mind, get out of the Matrix and stand up for your rights to be free human beings, free from oppression and indoctrination.
		Example: United Nations
		
		An Asshole:Hitler and [Stalin] are bad but I think [Obama] can change the country he seems honest... yeshecan, yeshecan, yeshecan...!
		A Guy:You better wake up, asshole...
		A former Asshole:([waking up])

		Example: MarkishMark said something retarded (again) and within minutes of his post hundreds of kids posted various [threats], insults and witty (sarcasm) name changes such as MarkSKIDMark under the [tag] of [United Spammers]. 

	(2008-10-24 +21/-6)

	- A queer nigger that hates other queer niggers.
	- Another guy sexually attracted to chloesprite, a man who gets lulz by posing as a girl. Obviously the idiot [that hits] on this git has mental probems.

	  An Urban dictionary Editor account that was started [August 31], 2008 as a response to Urban Dictionary making you log into your editor account in order to post comments in hopes that it would reduce spam. It has [garnished] a lot of popularity since then.
	   
	   The average comment from United Spammers    includes boob,s vagina, dicks, sex, [buttsecks], jizz, cum, etc. often in response to something chloesprite, markishmark (nicknamed "markSKIDmark" by United Spammers) or [cranky] lexiconologist (nicknamed cranky [gynaecologist] also by United Spammers)
	
	   Urban Dictionary put a limit on how many comments each account can post, most likely in response to United Spammers. United Spammers 2 was created so there could be more spam. UNITED QUEER NIGGERS, and QUEERUnitedSpammers2NiGGER are also [spin-off] accounts.
	
	   Everyone other than United Spammers themselves have appeared to have shown their disdain for them, but that only encourages them to post more crude comments. They do actually give critiques of the word, but in a sexual manner.
	
	   At these moment, they should be #16 on the top [contributing] editors list, but aren't featured there at all. A request was made from United Spammers to fairly include them, but seeing how everyone wants them gone, it's not likely that Urban Dictionary will give them any attention.
	
	   However, they give themselves attention, which is why there is a definition about them.
		Example: I have a lot of FUD about my mum finding out i love dads cock. Alot of the time i look over my shoulder and see if shes their, all i see is dads muscular body thrusting the shaft of his erect penis into my [sphinkter]. I like it when i lick the [goopy] excrement off, I like it.

United Stater
	(2007-09-08 +81/-39)
	Anyone who is not a native of [the United States of America].
	The term "American" fails to accurately describe someone living in the USA, because "America" refers to all of [North and South] America, so unless you are refering to each and every person on these two continents, you can not use the term "American". When refering to someone who lives in the USA, they are called a United Stater. Click [tater hater] for more information.
		Example: "Wow, [George Bush] is such a [United] Stater! So am I! So is everyone who lives in [the USA]!"
		
		United Staters are Americans, but Americans are not always United Staters.

They are indentified by their tan berets, Ranger Battalion unit scrolls, and [knarley] stares. These men are not to be crossed.
		Example: [Army Ranger] Battalions of the [75th] Ranger Regiment are notorious for maintaining their high level of training, and take pride on keeping every Ranger at a high level of physical fitness as well as having them far more skilled in their professions than any basic soldier/marine.
		
		Billy and Jimmy were hanging out with their frat bothers at a bar when one of them said the wrong thing to the wrong guy. After waking up in the ER, they were informed that they had been sent there by the group of United States [Army Rangers] they had popped off to, and that their girlfriends had left with the Rangers.

Our legacy is not slave chains, Wounded Knee, and the murder of James Byrd, but American GIs liberating a Nazi death camp, an [immigrant's] first glance of [lady liberty's] torch, and Ronald Reagan exhorting the [Soviet's] to tear down the Berlin Wall. If nothing else, America means freedom.

	Although a country bloated on consumer economy and [Big Mac's], the United States of America is diverse, free, and varied in ecosystems and landscapes. People of other nations seem to convienently forget that the USA hands out millions of dollars (and probably more) to charities, relief efforts, [foreign aid], and education, among other things. The USA has faults, like *every other country in the entire world*. But it seems to me the [downtrodden] people sneaking into America are biting their tongues...
		Example: The United States government has [remained] stable for over [200 years]. And I can't recall the last incredibly bloody "revolution", so much like [the European] ones, that's happened here...

	The United States is a country home to 150 million of the friendliest, most caring, decent people in the world. However, There are also a similar amount of racist, fundamental christian retards who seem to make [unilateral] decisions for the rest of the world.
	
	The United States government currently appears to be the most corrupt entity on the planet earth, sending thier brave and heroic soldiers to fight wars with the sole purpose of furthering individual ends. Your fanatical presidnet [Mr G].[W Bush], lacks the ability to engage in a initellignet conversation, nevermind [oversee] the actions of the worlds most powerful military arsenal.
	
	Their are severe ethnic divisions in the United States, despite the claim that the U.S. is the leader of the "free" world. Plus, anybody now wishing to travel to the U.S. will have all their personal details checked and stored at the whim of the CIA. This reflects the United States over-inflated self image, the U.S is not the [centre of the universe].
	
	This fact is reflected in history quite clearly. The United States government will engage in war in Iraq & Afghanistan, but will let the people of [Darfur] & Burma suffer extreme human rights abuses (not enough oil there you see). How many Americans know that during world war 2, there was only 1 country at war with Nazi Germany from the begining of the war? While Britain was bombed daily by the Germans, the American government refused to get invloved [militarily]. It was only when American [intrests] were attacked ([Pearl Harbour]) that the [U.S government] acted. Brtian was the only country to fight from day 1 - but you wont see that reflected anywhere in Hollywood. It seems that the [U.S. government] selfishly picks its battles...
	
	Anyway, the point is that the average decent American citizen gets treated like crap no matter where they go in the world. After visiting Mexico for example, the locals assumed that I must be American, and treated me with caution. Once they discovered I was British, it was a different story.
	
	America has great people, a fantastic environment, patriotism that I admire, many opportunities, but ultimatly  a government that stinks. Also whatever your government does, the British government does blindly. So next time your voting in our Prime minister, pick one with a backbane please!!

I eat [concertina], piss napalm, and I can shoot a round through a flea’s ass at 300 meters. I am a rough looking, roving soldier of the sea. I am cocky, self-centered, overbearing, and do not know the meaning of fear, for I am fear itself. I am a green amphibious monster, made of blood and guts, who arose from the sea, I travel the globe, festering on anti-Americans everywhere I go for, the love of Mom, Chevrolet, baseball, and apple pie. I’m a grunt. I’m the dirty, nasty, stinky, sweaty, filthy, beautiful little son of a bitch that’s kept wolf away from the door for over 235 years. I’m a [United States marine], we look like soldiers, talk like sailors, and slap the shit out of both of them. We stole the eagle from the Air Force, the rope from the Army, and the anchor from the Navy. And on the 7th Day, when God rested, we overran His perimeter, stole the globe, and we’ve been running the show ever since. Warrior by day, lover by night, drunkard by choice, Marine by God.

If the Marines were the best (as most military illiterate people think) we wouldn't need anyone else. Also the statement of them being the toughest is almost completely untrue. The statement itself is too ambiguous. Most recruits make it through Marine [BCT] while other branches have more strenuous training [regimen] than the overrated "[Crucible]".
		Example: Me- "I train everyday in hopes in one day being a SEAL team member. The dropout from Indoctrination through [BUD/s] and [SQT] is over 95% so I'm not going to slack on any of my preparation."
		
		Common Marine Fanboy who scored 10 below [ASVAB] standard-" Weak ass fag I'm joing the United States Marine Corps! OoORAaHh!!!"

United States Naval Academy
	(2009-06-17 +188/-74)
	A school designed to be utter hell but to fortify your future where other academy grads provide you jobs regardless of your competence. [Midshipmen] training includes condescension, premature judgments, and spreading pain previously received by the trainer because "it happened to them." Lieutenants act like Admirals and Senior [midshipmen] act like Lieutenants, while Senior Enlisted generally take out their own suffering and marital problems on the midshipmen. The average Naval Academy [midshipman] is a bro and drinking is a competitive sport. Service selection is based fifty percent on how well you hide your flaws from the public as well as general butt kissing. Alumni love the Naval Academy because their brains have blocked out the negative memories and only left the positives.
		Example: "I [went] to the United States Naval Academy, I [loved] it!"
		"Really? Why?"
		"[Uh], Its great!"

	(2006-09-15 +65/-304)
	The singular place of education where you can empower [the United States Navy] to shove a million dollar education up your ass a nickel at a time. The graduates, frequently known as "[ringknockers]" proudly display their trophy in the most arrogant and [assholish] fashion possible, peering down their noses at people who were direct commissions or graduated from NROTC units at other universities nationwide. These people go on to lead what tehy consider to be elitist lives and frequently get their asses kicked at squadron parties by many an aviator.
		Example: "I [graduated] from [the United States Naval Academy], class of [1998]. Where did YOU graduate from?"

	(2006-03-19 +83/-485)
	The United States "service academy" that claims to be the hardest in the nation.  Only there can you find [carpeted] barracks' (or rather dormitories), people to do your laundry for you, people to clean your barracks' for you (once again, rather dormitories), and people to serve you your meals.  The sissies there that call themselves [midshipmen] are given a commission into the [US Navy] or Marine [Corp] only to prove to other officers how arrogant they are wearing their expensive rings around as if they actually earned them.  The unfortunatre truth is that they stopped earning them several years ago.
		Example: [Unlike] other [service] academies, [the United States Naval Academy] fails to live up to it's name and traditions.

	(2003-08-05 +63/-38)
	Formost school of [naval] knowledege and practice in the world. produces both sailors and [marines] that [kick ass and take names].
		Example: That [marine] L.T that [shows] [Marines] are the best came from The United States Naval Academy

	(2005-03-23 +60/-47)
	With the hottest uniforms, the most beautiful campus, the best looking guys, and located in the greatest city in all the lands, The United States Naval Academy can very easily be called the finest military institution in the world.  It produces kick ass sailors and marines and who else has [the blue angels]??? March ons, fly [bys], [naptown], army/navy, kick ass... oh yess
		Example: [lets go] [downtown] and find some [middies]! ;)

	(2005-03-30 +45/-36)
	The [Severn] Higher [Institute of Technology] aka the place where a $268,000 education is shoved [up your anus] 1 nickel at a time.
		Example: [Damnit] Mom, I don't want to go back to The [United States Naval Academy], it's [IHTFP] every day there.

	(2005-06-10 +27/-43)
	An institution of higher learning where young men go to better themselves through a college degree and a career as a [naval officer] upon graduation, e.g. a million dollar education shoved up ones ass, a nickel at a time.
	Graduates of this institution are generally arrogant and believe themselves to be better than any of their fellow officers who did not become so by being a graduate of the naval academy (such as persons who became officers through NROTC programs, direct commissions or through OCS). These officers usually display their [USNA] class rings in an overly proud and flamboyant fashion, earning them the name "[Ringknockers]".
		Example: The United States [Naval] Acedmy is located in [Annapolis], [Maryland].

United States Obsession
	(2009-09-28 +71/-12)
	Is the term of a condition, used to describe a group of Non-Americans, with bias opinions, who are obsessed with talking about the United States of America.
	
	1. Many of these people have never even been to the United States, and get most of their information from Youtube, The Sun Newspaper or via their [Uncle Harry] who spent a two hour [layover] in JFK on his way to Toronto.
	
	2. It can be said, that most of these people are losers with no lives, that spend way too much time developing opinions on topics which they know jack shit about.
	
	3. Whether these people know it or not, Americans could [give a rats ass], if they like them or not. Which actually leads to why these people don't like the USA in the first place. But on the contrary, Americans don't give a shit anyway, so in reality, it doesn't matter.
	
	4. This group of people always over looks all the good the United States does for the world-
	
	*See the Polio Vaccine, AIDS research, [Cancer research], McDonald's, World's first successful airplane, Ketchup, First [lunar landing], [Garth Brooks]*
	
	-and focuses more so on the bad. But this is alright in an American's eyes; see number three.
	
	5. The Iraq war seems to be a hot topic among this group. They can spend hours, upon hours discussing how the United States started an unjust war. Whether they know it or not, most Americans agree with them on this subject, so no one really understands why they spend hours upon hours discussing a topic where the Americans agree with them anyway. So its a complete fucking mystery as to why an Anti-American would be agreeing with an actual American; see reason number two for explanation.
		Example: Person 1: The United States is filled with nothing but Fat People, who eat cheeseburgers all day.
		
		Person2: [And you know this] how?
		
		Person 1: I saw it on Telly.
		
		Person2: Right.....
		_____________________________
		
		Person 3: All Americans are stupid.
		
		Person 4: You do know that a lot of Medical [innovations], and life changing inventions, were made in the United States?
		
		Person 3. That doesn't matter. They invaded Iraq under false pretenses.
		
		Person 4: What does that have to do with Americans being stupid?
		
		Person 3: It just does.
		
		Person 4: Right.......
		______________________________
		
		[Person 5]: Person 1, and 3 has an United States Obsession.
		
		Person 1 and 3: No we don't!

United States of Canada
	(2004-11-30 +718/-178)
	All the [blue states] that voted for Kerry in the 2004 election... [the states] that are so embaressed that Bush won the election and wish they belong to Canada instead.
	
	Contrasted to all the red states, called [Jesusland].
		Example: After the [election], a new [map] was drawn showing the United States of Canada and [Jesusland].

	(2005-01-29 +190/-309)
	A joke that some Democrats tell about their states joining more liberal nations. In reality it would be stupid for Democrats to give up all control of the most powerful nation in the world, and it would be years before [voter] trends in "[Jesusland]" would allow even a single [blue state] to exist.
	
	But alas this joke is taken seriously by young Democrats who have never had a taste of defeat in politics, or just are too stupid to understand the difference between a joke and a demand.
	
	Had the Republicans lost I don't doubt the young among them would seriously think about abandoning California as a state.
		Example: We [lost] the [election]! Now we're gonna [secede]!

	(2005-01-26 +160/-536)
	A sad, pathetic attempt by liberals to cope with the fact that their own self [righteousness] doesn't actually mean that they are right.  Instead of graciously admitting that they are infact a minority in America, they would rather take their toys and go home, as evidenced by the "[USC]", similar to the southern states succession, but without the [backbone] to actually do anything about it except talk.
		Example: Liberal weiner: " I'm not an American anymore, I voted for Kerry and Im a USC citizen."
		Rational moderate: "Well, Kerry was a bad idea to begin with, maybe next time the Democrats will have a real contender I can vote for.  Oh well, back to work."
		[Religious Conservative]: "I'm glad this whole election is over, now we can get on to things that matter like fixing Social Security and the National [Sales Tax] and breaking up the pharmaceutical compny/Insurance [stranglehold] on medical care."

	(2008-03-14 +91/-42)
	Where former Jesuslanders go when they realize that the government is supposed to take care of everybody by forcing money from those who have it and giving it to those who don't.
	
	[Contrast] with [Jesusland] where people think that the church is supposed to take care of everybody by extracting money from anyone who will listen and building a bigger [cathedral] than the Jones' church down the street.
		Example: I moved to the [United States of Canada] after my preacher took my baby's [milk money] and bought an Xbox for his [church's] new million dollar youth building.

	(2009-02-18 +17/-87)
	A country which the United States and Canada together. 
	Ruled under dictatorship. 
	Government includes dictator, vice dictator, and [speaker of the house].
	National Anthem- Riot- [Three Days Grace]
	National Flower- Balloon Flower
	National Bird- [Macaroni] Penguin

United States of America
	(2011-09-30 +1088/-358)
	Let me describe the USA (the country I live in) from an unbiased viewpoint. Yes, many of us are ignorant, stupid, lazy, and racist. Yes, our government and job market is shit. Much of the accusations are true. However, as an American, I don't appreciate predominantly European people generalizing everybody in my country. I am ashamed at many of the things my [countrymen] have done throughout history, but it is also a country of equality, where anybody can make something of themself if they work hard enough. Home to some of the greatest musicians, [inventors], and scientists of all time. And not to be an [ignorant American], but we did help greatly in [World War Two]. Trying to "hog some glory"? More like winning essential battles, including [Normandy] (perhaps the most important battle of WWII) with the help of the British and Canadians, of course. Even though Europe was in an enormous state of turmoil, and we helped [the Allies] greatly, they cannot show gratitude, they can only judge us even more. And let me be perhaps the first in a long while to say: France, thank you for your tremendous help during the Revolution, we wouldn't have won it without you. I write this with the utmost respect for European countries, please respect us a little more, and don't just recognize the bad things about the USA, but the good things as well, as I do.
		Example: [Englishman]: The United States of America is full of ignorant, fat assholes!
		
		Americans: Our country is the best and the Europeans are [pessimistic] retards!
		
		See? Every country is full of ignorant, moronic people! Find the good in each country and their people, and acknowledge the bad, but don't [generalize] and discriminate.

	(2004-08-13 +2835/-982)
	[The World's Scapegoat]. 
	
	America's a pretty big place, and its full of all different kinds of people everywhere you go. 
	
	We're just a bunch of normal people living in a counrty with a messed up reputation and [a mighty] big spotlight for a mighty [small man].
		Example: [People] will be [people], wherever [they live].

	(2010-04-03 +744/-256)
	[Canada's] best friend. Who can kick some serious ass. Who has delicious foods, [sexy women] and is stereotyped. Like really, c'mon guys every country has their asses, not all Americans are stupid, dumb or mean. There is some [pretty decent] people in that country. And thats coming from a Canadian!
		Example: [Tim]: United States of America sucks.
		Hortons: Tim your a [dumb-ass], [USA rocks]!

	[Thumbs down], Thumbs up, or whatever you want, but at [leat] [hear me out] first.----------
	
	The country located between Mexico (to the south) and Canada (to the north).
	
	Most people hate the USA for being [imperfect], but they fail to see the TRUE America
	
	1) Not everyone here is an obnoxious prick. There are some acctually informed and nice people here, as well as assholes, just like in EVERY OTHER COUNTRY.
	
	2) Of course we are proud to be American, but that doesn't mean we are arrogant. If you are not proud of your country, then why do you live there?
	
	3)Not every American is diebetic and fat, so shut the fuck up.
	
	4)Yea, we know that some countries dislike us, we also know that we have allies as well. And we DO know that there are other countries that exist beyond the USA. Were not as retarded as you think.
	
	5)We know our government is not perfect
	
	6) Unfortunately, most people judge us before they even know us
	
	Now before you get upset, im not saying there os [no country] that understands the USA
		Example: The United States of America is home to the largest Naval Base in the world, in [Norfolk], Virginia. And also the oldest constitutuion that is still in effet today.
		
		Most Non-Americans: Say, are you American?
		
		Non-Ignorant American: Yes.
		
		Most Non-Americans: I can smell the arrogance and [hamburgers] on you from here! Get away from me----
		
		American: I honestly have [no response] to that :|
		
		***I am proud to be american, as you are proud to be whatever nationality you come from.

	(2010-06-22 +284/-141)
	(1) [A nation] that has received so much crap from other people around the world for being [imperfect].
	
	(2) A nation that has adopted [indigent] children from countries all around the world called immigrants who sought a haven from their home countries for various reasons including economic opportunity that the home country could not convey.
	
	(3) A nation that is so quickly (and wrongly) criticized due to a very small minority of so-called "patriots" consisting of imbeciles arrogant enough to believe they speak for 300,000,000 people and ignorant enough to spread the stereotypes of Americans.
		Example: [European]: "Man, [the United States of America] sucks!"
		Canadian: "I know right?"
		
		American: "[Ignorant prick]..."

	(2010-09-21 +243/-130)
	A place you're proud to call home. You will accept no other substitute for freedom, and you will not accept crappy definitions for [the land] of [the free] and the brave.
	
	Most of all, [GO AMERICA].
		Example: Because I live in [the United States of America], I can choose [what to do] with my money! GO [CAPITALISM]!

	(2011-11-21 +35/-16)
	Also known as America, USA, United States, or [The States]; it is often the center of stereotypes and misunderstanding.
	
	No. Not everyone in the country is fat. In fact, Germany has more overweight people than the United States.
	
	No. Not everyone is arrogant and self-centered. Just like every single effing country on the planet, America [has it's] share. But many many people are kind hearted and thoughtful
	
	No. Not everyone is a gun-toting crazy bastard. The United States may be high in crime, but there are more than 300 million people spread through out the country. Many foreigners come to America thinking they'd have the freedom to take someone else's freedom away.
	
	No. Not everyone is stupid. Without America, you wouldn't have the internet you are on right now. Without America, planes wouldn't be as developed, or even invented. The US has a mix of millions of people from around the world: their knowledge combined.
	
	Yes. The United States is having some financial problems. So is everyone else! Give the country a break! Only being [235] years old, already being a [superpower], and fighting in 2 World Wars, you have to give them some credit. The countries in Europe existed for thousands of years. They had thousands of years to get their government [in check].
	
	The United States of America has come very far. The people have different cultures in different areas; from New England, to California: everything and [everyone is different]. Don't judge on stereotypes.
		Example: "[The United States of America] sucks. I'm moving."
		"Why?"
		"Everyone is fat, stupid, and lazy!"
		". . . So are a bunch of people in Canada, [Europe], and [Asia]."
		"..."

	(2009-11-27 +130/-79)
	A nation which, along with being one of the few remaining superpowers of the world, is filled with all types of people. The USA is a [multicultural] nation consisting of a Caucasian majority, which will have changed to an Hispanic majority by the year [2050].
	
	Unfortunately, most of the world (including many Americans) does not realize that, though we throw the word "democracy" around quite a bit, the US is a Republic, [modeled] after Rome. If you can’t tell the difference, look it up.
		Example: A few important facts about the United States of America:
		
		1. We are not all stupid, nor are we ignorant or intolerant.
		
		2. Yes, we have [had bad] leaders. So has every other nation on Earth. Unfortunately, the US is under a bigger spotlight politically than most of the world, and our mistakes seem bigger. Get over it.
		
		3. America is as full of patriots as it is dissenters, and that is one of the things that make the country great. The ability to [speak freely] and without reason to fear the government is more than many nations can boast.
		
		4. Yes, we speak a mockery of the English language. Don't fault us on how we speak, because every language came from another.
		
		5. No, we don't hate Canada. [As a matter of fact], Canada and the United States of America would be [bestest friends] if they were individual people.
		
		6. We have the longest standing Constitution of any nation today, and we are proud that we have maintained a strong relation to our roots.
		
		7. We are not all arrogant, racist, ignorant bastards, so please, stop using the Internet to call us so. Also, really, how many people who comment on our ignorance have met an American from the majority of the population? (No, COPS is not an accurate representation of the majority, and I suggest you stop watching the program, it [rots] your brain)

United States of Generica
	(2006-08-12 +87/-5)
	Suburban areas where the predominance of malls and chain stores have so [homogenized] the landscape that there are few remaining external [clues] where you are. The result of spending any length of time in such areas is a "generic" experience of America, i.e., an experience that is identical whether you are in Texas, Massachusetts, Ohio, or California. May also include extensive housing developments characterized by [tract housing] or, worse, McMansions.
		Example: Every "mom-and-pop" shop that had given the area its charm and character had been replaced by a Walmart, a [Payless], a McDonalds, or [a Starbucks] -- transforming what was once a delightful town into just another corner of the United States of [Generica].

United States of the Offended
	(2005-04-08 +84/-36)
	A term devised by Robert D. [Raiford], curmudgeon-at-large, and the only REAL reason to listen to the John Boy and Billy show.  It's what the good ol' U.S. of A have become thanks to the panty-waisted touchy-feely liberal types who go out of their way looking for something to offend them, and get said panties in a knot when they find it.  Hey, it's called the right to freedom of speech, [ya horse's] ass.  Go check out the first ammendment.  NOWHERE does it say that you have the right not to be offended.  So quit calling for more tolerance and diversity training, and just learn to deal with it.  Instead of trying to make us all overly sensitive, why the hell don't you go out and get a real job, and mind your own damn business.  Sometimes [the truth's] a bitch, fuckers.
		Example: Wow, we can't say ____ anymore because some group got their poor little [feeler's] hurt and [pitched] a fit and made everyone take sensitivity training?  Geez, some people get their [skivvies] in a twist over the most trivial things.  It's like we're living in the United States of the Offended or something.

United States of Whatever
	(2005-11-19 +57/-17)
	1)America as seen by basically anyone over twelve and under 25. 
	2)Responding to everything with very simple [open-ended] phrases [like whatever], that's cool, or yo. 
	3)A very funny song by Liam Lynch that captures pure [teen angst].
		Example: I was [at the beach] and I saw [Kiki], and she was like euwhh, and I was like whatever. This is my [united states of whatever].

	(2003-02-27 +40/-19)
	"Whatever." Allusion to Liam [Lynch's] (of [Sifl and Olly]) song "[United States of Whatever]".

United Statian
	(2008-06-17 +1086/-85)
	A United [Statian] (or simply Statian) is a person from the United States of America, since the term American refers to any person in the western [hemisphere].
	
	As the example above points out, if there was a country in Africa called "United States of Africa" then anyone from Africa would be an African not just people from that country.
	
	Here is also another example; people from the [United Arab Emirates] are called "Emiratis" why aren't they called "Arabs" if they have the term Arab in their name? simply, because it overlaps with the other Arabs, in the same way the term American only to refer to US citizens overlaps with all the other Americans.
		Example: The United Statian (State-ian) [government] has declared [war on] [Iraq].
		
		Statians are among the friendliest people in the world.

	(2007-05-18 +655/-272)
	Most NON-English speaking countries, specially in [Latin America] and Europe, refer to people from the USA as "Estadounidenses", "Etats-Uniens", etc. (United Statian) which is the right way to call them, because anyone who's born in the American Contienent, it's an American. 
	
	It's like if there was a country [in Europe], named United States of Europe, and they auto call themselves "[Europeans]", anyone how lived in Europe would be an European, not just people from that country; in the same way, anyone who lives in America(s) is an American not just people from the USA.
		Example: Todos somos Americanos, [desde] Canada hasta Argentina, y los Estadounidences no tienen [derecho] de tomar nuestro nombre. 
		
		Where are all Americans, from Canada to Argentina, and the [United Statians] have no right to take our name. 

	(2010-02-16 +90/-40)
	People from Saoudi [Arabia] are Saoudis. Not arabians or arabs.
	America is a continent, not a country.
	Latin america already calls them that.
	Every kid in [Canadia] is confused whenever they hear Americans on the television, until their parents tell them United Statians have an ego( that only Kanye West, coincidently another [United Statian], rivals) so enormous that they have to take the name of the entire continent they live in.
	Also see: Canadia
		Example: George: Dear, those damned United Statians make me wish we lost world war II after all.
		Clara: Their ego is probably causing global warming.
		Samantha: They don't even realize that the higher IQ States vote for democrats and lower IQ ones vote for republicans, how can they be so proud of a nation that most of the time is run by stupidity?
		Laurence: [Want some more] weed, George?
		George: Sure. And let's get back to what we were doing earlier, lets not forget men in Canadia get at least three cultured and hot women to do their bidding.
		Women: As you wish, my lord!

	I just wanted to point out the Spanish word "Estadaunidenses" which is [a real word] (unlike "United Statians") but is the same thing (rather than "Americanos" which is [almost never] used to [mean people] from the USA).
		Example: United Statians are [cool].

	(2007-07-09 +59/-53)
	A polemical term used to describe people from the United States of America. For historic and cultural reasons, people from the States refer to themselves as "Americans", whereas in all of Latin America, the word "américano" refers to anyone from the Americas.  Therefore Latin Americans refer to people from the States as "estadounidenses" (United Statians) rather than "americanos".
	
	Due to Americans [obliviousness] of this issue of [transcendence] in Latin America, a Chilean group has even written a song that describes American mentality when thinking of Latin America.  It is entitled: “Latin America is a town south of the United States.”
	
	Many Latin Americans would like to change the English term "American" to "[United Statian]" and the word "American" to refer of all people from the Americas (North, South and Central). It is an issue heatedly discussed in many forums on the internet.
	
	
		Example: Nick: Why do Latin [Americans] want to call us United Statians?
		Jen: I think they´ve got a bit of an [inferiority complex], I´ve never had a Canadian challenge [my definition] of "American".
		

	(2006-02-27 +818/-2448)
	A word used to describe people from [the United States] without [confusing] them with people from [South America].Also used when the word American cannot be thought of.
		Example: United Statians are some of the luckiest [citizens] in [the world].

United Stater
	(2007-09-08 +81/-39)
	Anyone who is not a native of [the United States of America].
	The term "American" fails to accurately describe someone living in the USA, because "America" refers to all of [North and South] America, so unless you are refering to each and every person on these two continents, you can not use the term "American". When refering to someone who lives in the USA, they are called a United Stater. Click [tater hater] for more information.
		Example: "Wow, [George Bush] is such a [United] Stater! So am I! So is everyone who lives in [the USA]!"
		
		United Staters are Americans, but Americans are not always United Staters.
		
		There are over 300 million United Staters.

These individuals are specially trained, and endure various selection/training processes in order to gain entrance into the 75th. They fall under USASOC, are considered "specialized infantry", and have a very specific mission set with in the special operations realm. They are indentified by their tan berets, Ranger Battalion unit scrolls, and [knarley] stares. These men are not to be crossed.
		Example: [Army Ranger] Battalions of the [75th] Ranger Regiment are notorious for maintaining their high level of training, and take pride on keeping every Ranger at a high level of physical fitness as well as having them far more skilled in their professions than any basic soldier/marine.
		
		Billy and Jimmy were hanging out with their frat bothers at a bar when one of them said the wrong thing to the wrong guy. After waking up in the ER, they were informed that they had been sent there by the group of United States [Army Rangers] they had popped off to, and that their girlfriends had left with the Rangers.
		
		Extremist organizations want no part of the soldiers of the 75th Ranger Regiment... Doesn't make business sense.

	United Spammers (n) - A person or group that is dedicated to posting some of the dumbest shit on Urban Dictionary. Takes anonymous and takes a [big shit] on it. 
	
	The group consists of:
	- A homosexual idiot that likes to talk about having sex with himself.
	- A queer nigger that hates other queer niggers.
	- Another guy sexually attracted to chloesprite, a man who gets lulz by posing as a girl. Obviously the idiot [that hits] on this git has mental probems.
	
	Anyone wanting to be this fag should log-in using

	  An Urban dictionary Editor account that was started [August 31], 2008 as a response to Urban Dictionary making you log into your editor account in order to post comments in hopes that it would reduce spam. It has [garnished] a lot of popularity since then.
	   
	   The average comment from United Spammers    includes boob,s vagina, dicks, sex, [buttsecks], jizz, cum, etc. often in response to something chloesprite, markishmark (nicknamed "markSKIDmark" by United Spammers) or [cranky] lexiconologist (nicknamed cranky [gynaecologist] also by United Spammers)
	
	   Urban Dictionary put a limit on how many comments each account can post, most likely in response to United Spammers. United Spammers 2 was created so there could be more spam. UNITED QUEER NIGGERS, and QUEERUnitedSpammers2NiGGER are also [spin-off] accounts.
	
	   Everyone other than United Spammers themselves have appeared to have shown their disdain for them, but that only encourages them to post more crude comments. They do actually give critiques of the word, but in a sexual manner.
	
	   At these moment, they should be #16 on the top [contributing] editors list, but aren't featured there at all. A request was made from United Spammers to fairly include them, but seeing how everyone wants them gone, it's not likely that Urban Dictionary will give them any attention.
	
	   However, they give themselves attention, which is why there is a definition about them.
		Example: I have a lot of FUD about my mum finding out i love dads cock. Alot of the time i look over my shoulder and see if shes their, all i see is dads muscular body thrusting the shaft of his erect penis into my [sphinkter]. I like it when i lick the [goopy] excrement off, I like it.

	Although a country bloated on consumer economy and [Big Mac's], the United States of America is diverse, free, and varied in ecosystems and landscapes. People of other nations seem to convienently forget that the USA hands out millions of dollars (and probably more) to charities, relief efforts, [foreign aid], and education, among other things. The USA has faults, like *every other country in the entire world*. But it seems to me the [downtrodden] people sneaking into America are biting their tongues...

	The United States is a country home to 150 million of the friendliest, most caring, decent people in the world. However, There are also a similar amount of racist, fundamental christian retards who seem to make [unilateral] decisions for the rest of the world.
	
	The United States government currently appears to be the most corrupt entity on the planet earth, sending thier brave and heroic soldiers to fight wars with the sole purpose of furthering individual ends. Your fanatical presidnet [Mr G].[W Bush], lacks the ability to engage in a initellignet conversation, nevermind [oversee] the actions of the worlds most powerful military arsenal.
	
	Their are severe ethnic divisions in the United States, despite the claim that the U.S. is the leader of the "free" world. Plus, anybody now wishing to travel to the U.S. will have all their personal details checked and stored at the whim of the CIA. This reflects the United States over-inflated self image, the U.S is not the [centre of the universe].
	
	This fact is reflected in history quite clearly. The United States government will engage in war in Iraq & Afghanistan, but will let the people of [Darfur] & Burma suffer extreme human rights abuses (not enough oil there you see). How many Americans know that during world war 2, there was only 1 country at war with Nazi Germany from the begining of the war? While Britain was bombed daily by the Germans, the American government refused to get invloved [militarily]. It was only when American [intrests] were attacked ([Pearl Harbour]) that the [U.S government] acted. Brtian was the only country to fight from day 1 - but you wont see that reflected anywhere in Hollywood. It seems that the [U.S. government] selfishly picks its battles...
	
	Anyway, the point is that the average decent American citizen gets treated like crap no matter where they go in the world. After visiting Mexico for example, the locals assumed that I must be American, and treated me with caution. Once they discovered I was British, it was a different story.
	
	America has great people, a fantastic environment, patriotism that I admire, many opportunities, but ultimatly  a government that stinks. Also whatever your government does, the British government does blindly. So next time your voting in our Prime minister, pick one with a backbane please!!

United States Marine Corps
	(2011-01-18 +653/-49)
	[10 November] 1775: I was born in a bomb crater. My mother was an M16 and my father was the Devil. Each moment that I live is an additional threat upon your life. I eat [concertina], piss napalm, and I can shoot a round through a flea’s ass at 300 meters. I am a rough looking, roving soldier of the sea. I am cocky, self-centered, overbearing, and do not know the meaning of fear, for I am fear itself. I am a green amphibious monster, made of blood and guts, who arose from the sea, I travel the globe, festering on anti-Americans everywhere I go for, the love of Mom, Chevrolet, baseball, and apple pie. I’m a grunt. I’m the dirty, nasty, stinky, sweaty, filthy, beautiful little son of a bitch that’s kept wolf away from the door for over 235 years. I’m a [United States marine], we look like soldiers, talk like sailors, and slap the shit out of both of them. We stole the eagle from the Air Force, the rope from the Army, and the anchor from the Navy. And on the 7th Day, when God rested, we overran His perimeter, stole the globe, and we’ve been running the show ever since. Warrior by day, lover by night, drunkard by choice, Marine by God.
	
	[Simper Fidelis]

	We stole the rope from the Army, [the anchor] from the Navy, the eagle from the Air Force and on the 7th day when God rested, we overran his perimeter and stole the globe and we've pretty much been [running the show] ever since. [OOHRAH]!
		Example: What?!?! You accomplished [the mission] with absolutely no funding and you still kicked more ass than the Army? That is so United States [Marine Corps] of you.
		
		I wish the other military branches weren't such bitches and they could [grow a pair] like the United States Marine Corps.

	(2009-04-25 +108/-477)
	Unlike what most people say it is not "better" than the army or any other branch. Each branch has it's [on set] of jobs and application in times of war. If the Marines were the best (as most military illiterate people think) we wouldn't need anyone else. Also the statement of them being the toughest is almost completely untrue. The statement itself is too ambiguous. Most recruits make it through Marine [BCT] while other branches have more strenuous training [regimen] than the overrated "[Crucible]".
		Example: Me- "I train everyday in hopes in one day being a SEAL team member. The dropout from Indoctrination through [BUD/s] and [SQT] is over 95% so I'm not going to slack on any of my preparation."

	(2009-06-17 +188/-74)
	A school designed to be utter hell but to fortify your future where other academy grads provide you jobs regardless of your competence. [Midshipmen] training includes condescension, premature judgments, and spreading pain previously received by the trainer because "it happened to them." Lieutenants act like Admirals and Senior [midshipmen] act like Lieutenants, while Senior Enlisted generally take out their own suffering and marital problems on the midshipmen. The average Naval Academy [midshipman] is a bro and drinking is a competitive sport. Service selection is based fifty percent on how well you hide your flaws from the public as well as general butt kissing. Alumni love the Naval Academy because their brains have blocked out the negative memories and only left the positives.
		Example: "I [went] to the United States Naval Academy, I [loved] it!"
		"Really? Why?"
		"[Uh], Its great!"

	(2006-09-15 +65/-304)
	The singular place of education where you can empower [the United States Navy] to shove a million dollar education up your ass a nickel at a time. The graduates, frequently known as "[ringknockers]" proudly display their trophy in the most arrogant and [assholish] fashion possible, peering down their noses at people who were direct commissions or graduated from NROTC units at other universities nationwide. These people go on to lead what tehy consider to be elitist lives and frequently get their asses kicked at squadron parties by many an aviator.
		Example: "I [graduated] from [the United States Naval Academy], class of [1998]. Where did YOU graduate from?"

	(2006-03-19 +83/-485)
	The United States "service academy" that claims to be the hardest in the nation.  Only there can you find [carpeted] barracks' (or rather dormitories), people to do your laundry for you, people to clean your barracks' for you (once again, rather dormitories), and people to serve you your meals.  The sissies there that call themselves [midshipmen] are given a commission into the [US Navy] or Marine [Corp] only to prove to other officers how arrogant they are wearing their expensive rings around as if they actually earned them.  The unfortunatre truth is that they stopped earning them several years ago.
		Example: [Unlike] other [service] academies, [the United States Naval Academy] fails to live up to it's name and traditions.

	(2003-08-05 +63/-38)
	Formost school of [naval] knowledege and practice in the world. produces both sailors and [marines] that [kick ass and take names].

	An institution of higher learning where young men go to better themselves through a college degree and a career as a [naval officer] upon graduation, e.g. a million dollar education shoved up ones ass, a nickel at a time.
	Graduates of this institution are generally arrogant and believe themselves to be better than any of their fellow officers who did not become so by being a graduate of the naval academy (such as persons who became officers through NROTC programs, direct commissions or through OCS). These officers usually display their [USNA] class rings in an overly proud and flamboyant fashion, earning them the name "[Ringknockers]".

United States Obsession
	(2009-09-28 +71/-12)
	Is the term of a condition, used to describe a group of Non-Americans, with bias opinions, who are obsessed with talking about the United States of America.
	
	1. Many of these people have never even been to the United States, and get most of their information from Youtube, The Sun Newspaper or via their [Uncle Harry] who spent a two hour [layover] in JFK on his way to Toronto.
	
	2. It can be said, that most of these people are losers with no lives, that spend way too much time developing opinions on topics which they know jack shit about.
	
	3. Whether these people know it or not, Americans could [give a rats ass], if they like them or not. Which actually leads to why these people don't like the USA in the first place. But on the contrary, Americans don't give a shit anyway, so in reality, it doesn't matter.
	
	4. This group of people always over looks all the good the United States does for the world-
	
	*See the Polio Vaccine, AIDS research, [Cancer research], McDonald's, World's first successful airplane, Ketchup, First [lunar landing], [Garth Brooks]*
	
	-and focuses more so on the bad. But this is alright in an American's eyes; see number three.
	
	5. The Iraq war seems to be a hot topic among this group. They can spend hours, upon hours discussing how the United States started an unjust war. Whether they know it or not, most Americans agree with them on this subject, so no one really understands why they spend hours upon hours discussing a topic where the Americans agree with them anyway. So its a complete fucking mystery as to why an Anti-American would be agreeing with an actual American; see reason number two for explanation.
		Example: Person 1: The United States is filled with nothing but Fat People, who eat cheeseburgers all day.
		
		Person2: [And you know this] how?
		
		Person 1: I saw it on Telly.
		
		Person2: Right.....
		_____________________________
		
		Person 3: All Americans are stupid.
		
		Person 4: You do know that a lot of Medical [innovations], and life changing inventions, were made in the United States?
		
		Person 3. That doesn't matter. They invaded Iraq under false pretenses.
		
		Person 4: What does that have to do with Americans being stupid?
		
		Person 3: It just does.
		
		Person 4: Right.......

United States of America
	(2011-09-30 +1088/-358)
	Let me describe the USA (the country I live in) from an unbiased viewpoint. Yes, many of us are ignorant, stupid, lazy, and racist. Yes, our government and job market is shit. Much of the accusations are true. However, as an American, I don't appreciate predominantly European people generalizing everybody in my country. I am ashamed at many of the things my [countrymen] have done throughout history, but it is also a country of equality, where anybody can make something of themself if they work hard enough. Home to some of the greatest musicians, [inventors], and scientists of all time. And not to be an [ignorant American], but we did help greatly in [World War Two]. Trying to "hog some glory"? More like winning essential battles, including [Normandy] (perhaps the most important battle of WWII) with the help of the British and Canadians, of course. Even though Europe was in an enormous state of turmoil, and we helped [the Allies] greatly, they cannot show gratitude, they can only judge us even more. And let me be perhaps the first in a long while to say: France, thank you for your tremendous help during the Revolution, we wouldn't have won it without you. I write this with the utmost respect for European countries, please respect us a little more, and don't just recognize the bad things about the USA, but the good things as well, as I do.
		Example: [Englishman]: The United States of America is full of ignorant, fat assholes!
		
		Americans: Our country is the best and the Europeans are [pessimistic] retards!
		
		See? Every country is full of ignorant, moronic people! Find the good in each country and their people, and acknowledge the bad, but don't [generalize] and discriminate.

	Most people hate the USA for being [imperfect], but they fail to see the TRUE America
	
	1) Not everyone here is an obnoxious prick. There are some acctually informed and nice people here, as well as assholes, just like in EVERY OTHER COUNTRY.
	
	2) Of course we are proud to be American, but that doesn't mean we are arrogant. If you are not proud of your country, then why do you live there?
	
	3)Not every American is diebetic and fat, so shut the fuck up.
	
	4)Yea, we know that some countries dislike us, we also know that we have allies as well. And we DO know that there are other countries that exist beyond the USA. Were not as retarded as you think.
	
	5)We know our government is not perfect
	
	6) Unfortunately, most people judge us before they even know us
	
	Now before you get upset, im not saying there os [no country] that understands the USA

		Most Non-Americans: Say, are you American?
		
		Non-Ignorant American: Yes.
		
		Most Non-Americans: I can smell the arrogance and [hamburgers] on you from here! Get away from me----

	(3) A nation that is so quickly (and wrongly) criticized due to a very small minority of so-called "patriots" consisting of imbeciles arrogant enough to believe they speak for 300,000,000 people and ignorant enough to spread the stereotypes of Americans.
		Example: [European]: "Man, [the United States of America] sucks!"
		Canadian: "I know right?"
		
		American: "[Ignorant prick]..."

	(2010-09-21 +243/-130)
	A place you're proud to call home. You will accept no other substitute for freedom, and you will not accept crappy definitions for [the land] of [the free] and the brave.
	
	Most of all, [GO AMERICA].
		Example: Because I live in [the United States of America], I can choose [what to do] with my money! GO [CAPITALISM]!

	(2011-11-21 +35/-16)
	Also known as America, USA, United States, or [The States]; it is often the center of stereotypes and misunderstanding.
	
	No. Not everyone in the country is fat. In fact, Germany has more overweight people than the United States.
	
	No. Not everyone is arrogant and self-centered. Just like every single effing country on the planet, America [has it's] share. But many many people are kind hearted and thoughtful
	
	No. Not everyone is a gun-toting crazy bastard. The United States may be high in crime, but there are more than 300 million people spread through out the country. Many foreigners come to America thinking they'd have the freedom to take someone else's freedom away.
	
	No. Not everyone is stupid. Without America, you wouldn't have the internet you are on right now. Without America, planes wouldn't be as developed, or even invented. The US has a mix of millions of people from around the world: their knowledge combined.
	
	Yes. The United States is having some financial problems. So is everyone else! Give the country a break! Only being [235] years old, already being a [superpower], and fighting in 2 World Wars, you have to give them some credit. The countries in Europe existed for thousands of years. They had thousands of years to get their government [in check].
	
	The United States of America has come very far. The people have different cultures in different areas; from New England, to California: everything and [everyone is different]. Don't judge on stereotypes.
		Example: "[The United States of America] sucks. I'm moving."
		"Why?"
		"Everyone is fat, stupid, and lazy!"
		". . . So are a bunch of people in Canada, [Europe], and [Asia]."
		"..."

	(2009-11-27 +130/-79)
	A nation which, along with being one of the few remaining superpowers of the world, is filled with all types of people. The USA is a [multicultural] nation consisting of a Caucasian majority, which will have changed to an Hispanic majority by the year [2050].
	
	Unfortunately, most of the world (including many Americans) does not realize that, though we throw the word "democracy" around quite a bit, the US is a Republic, [modeled] after Rome. If you can’t tell the difference, look it up.
		Example: A few important facts about the United States of America:
		
		1. We are not all stupid, nor are we ignorant or intolerant.
		
		2. Yes, we have [had bad] leaders. So has every other nation on Earth. Unfortunately, the US is under a bigger spotlight politically than most of the world, and our mistakes seem bigger. Get over it.
		
		3. America is as full of patriots as it is dissenters, and that is one of the things that make the country great. The ability to [speak freely] and without reason to fear the government is more than many nations can boast.
		
		4. Yes, we speak a mockery of the English language. Don't fault us on how we speak, because every language came from another.
		
		5. No, we don't hate Canada. [As a matter of fact], Canada and the United States of America would be [bestest friends] if they were individual people.
		
		6. We have the longest standing Constitution of any nation today, and we are proud that we have maintained a strong relation to our roots.
		
		7. We are not all arrogant, racist, ignorant bastards, so please, stop using the Internet to call us so. Also, really, how many people who comment on our ignorance have met an American from the majority of the population? (No, COPS is not an accurate representation of the majority, and I suggest you stop watching the program, it [rots] your brain)

United States of Canada
	(2004-11-30 +718/-178)
	All the [blue states] that voted for Kerry in the 2004 election... [the states] that are so embaressed that Bush won the election and wish they belong to Canada instead.
	
	Contrasted to all the red states, called [Jesusland].
		Example: After the [election], a new [map] was drawn showing the United States of Canada and [Jesusland].

	(2005-01-29 +190/-309)
	A joke that some Democrats tell about their states joining more liberal nations. In reality it would be stupid for Democrats to give up all control of the most powerful nation in the world, and it would be years before [voter] trends in "[Jesusland]" would allow even a single [blue state] to exist.
	
	But alas this joke is taken seriously by young Democrats who have never had a taste of defeat in politics, or just are too stupid to understand the difference between a joke and a demand.
	
	Had the Republicans lost I don't doubt the young among them would seriously think about abandoning California as a state.
		Example: We [lost] the [election]! Now we're gonna [secede]!

	(2005-01-26 +160/-536)
	A sad, pathetic attempt by liberals to cope with the fact that their own self [righteousness] doesn't actually mean that they are right.  Instead of graciously admitting that they are infact a minority in America, they would rather take their toys and go home, as evidenced by the "[USC]", similar to the southern states succession, but without the [backbone] to actually do anything about it except talk.
		Example: Liberal weiner: " I'm not an American anymore, I voted for Kerry and Im a USC citizen."
		Rational moderate: "Well, Kerry was a bad idea to begin with, maybe next time the Democrats will have a real contender I can vote for.  Oh well, back to work."
		[Religious Conservative]: "I'm glad this whole election is over, now we can get on to things that matter like fixing Social Security and the National [Sales Tax] and breaking up the pharmaceutical compny/Insurance [stranglehold] on medical care."

	(2008-03-14 +91/-42)
	Where former Jesuslanders go when they realize that the government is supposed to take care of everybody by forcing money from those who have it and giving it to those who don't.
	
	[Contrast] with [Jesusland] where people think that the church is supposed to take care of everybody by extracting money from anyone who will listen and building a bigger [cathedral] than the Jones' church down the street.
		Example: I moved to the [United States of Canada] after my preacher took my baby's [milk money] and bought an Xbox for his [church's] new million dollar youth building.

	(2009-02-18 +17/-87)
	A country which the United States and Canada together. 
	Ruled under dictatorship. 
	Government includes dictator, vice dictator, and [speaker of the house].
	National Anthem- Riot- [Three Days Grace]
	National Flower- Balloon Flower
	National Bird- [Macaroni] Penguin 
	
		Example: [The United States] of [Canada] is the BEST [country] in the world!

United States of Generica
	(2006-08-12 +87/-5)
	Suburban areas where the predominance of malls and chain stores have so [homogenized] the landscape that there are few remaining external [clues] where you are. The result of spending any length of time in such areas is a "generic" experience of America, i.e., an experience that is identical whether you are in Texas, Massachusetts, Ohio, or California. May also include extensive housing developments characterized by [tract housing] or, worse, McMansions.
		Example: Every "mom-and-pop" shop that had given the area its charm and character had been replaced by a Walmart, a [Payless], a McDonalds, or [a Starbucks] -- transforming what was once a delightful town into just another corner of the United States of [Generica].

United States of the Offended
	(2005-04-08 +84/-36)
	A term devised by Robert D. [Raiford], curmudgeon-at-large, and the only REAL reason to listen to the John Boy and Billy show.  It's what the good ol' U.S. of A have become thanks to the panty-waisted touchy-feely liberal types who go out of their way looking for something to offend them, and get said panties in a knot when they find it.  Hey, it's called the right to freedom of speech, [ya horse's] ass.  Go check out the first ammendment.  NOWHERE does it say that you have the right not to be offended.  So quit calling for more tolerance and diversity training, and just learn to deal with it.  Instead of trying to make us all overly sensitive, why the hell don't you go out and get a real job, and mind your own damn business.  Sometimes [the truth's] a bitch, fuckers.
		Example: Wow, we can't say ____ anymore because some group got their poor little [feeler's] hurt and [pitched] a fit and made everyone take sensitivity training?  Geez, some people get their [skivvies] in a twist over the most trivial things.  It's like we're living in the United States of the Offended or something.

United States of Whatever
	(2005-11-19 +57/-17)
	1)America as seen by basically anyone over twelve and under 25. 
	2)Responding to everything with very simple [open-ended] phrases [like whatever], that's cool, or yo. 
	3)A very funny song by Liam Lynch that captures pure [teen angst].
		Example: I was [at the beach] and I saw [Kiki], and she was like euwhh, and I was like whatever. This is my [united states of whatever].

	(2003-02-27 +40/-19)

	(2003-06-03 +21/-18)
	[awesome] [song].
		Example: yeah, i was walking [down the street] and this guys like "[hey you] can't do that!"..."Yea...[WHATEVER]!"

_____

United Statian
	(2008-06-17 +1086/-85)
	A United [Statian] (or simply Statian) is a person from the United States of America, since the term American refers to any person in the western [hemisphere].
	
	As the example above points out, if there was a country in Africa called "United States of Africa" then anyone from Africa would be an African not just people from that country.
	
	Here is also another example; people from the [United Arab Emirates] are called "Emiratis" why aren't they called "Arabs" if they have the term Arab in their name? simply, because it overlaps with the other Arabs, in the same way the term American only to refer to US citizens overlaps with all the other Americans.
		Example: The United Statian (State-ian) [government] has declared [war on] [Iraq].
		
		Statians are among the friendliest people in the world.

	(2007-05-18 +655/-272)
	Most NON-English speaking countries, specially in [Latin America] and Europe, refer to people from the USA as "Estadounidenses", "Etats-Uniens", etc. (United Statian) which is the right way to call them, because anyone who's born in the American Contienent, it's an American. 
	
	It's like if there was a country [in Europe], named United States of Europe, and they auto call themselves "[Europeans]", anyone how lived in Europe would be an European, not just people from that country; in the same way, anyone who lives in America(s) is an American not just people from the USA.
		Example: Todos somos Americanos, [desde] Canada hasta Argentina, y los Estadounidences no tienen [derecho] de tomar nuestro nombre. 
		
		Where are all Americans, from Canada to Argentina, and the [United Statians] have no right to take our name. 

	(2010-02-16 +90/-40)
	People from Saoudi [Arabia] are Saoudis. Not arabians or arabs.
	America is a continent, not a country.
	Latin america already calls them that.
	Every kid in [Canadia] is confused whenever they hear Americans on the television, until their parents tell them United Statians have an ego( that only Kanye West, coincidently another [United Statian], rivals) so enormous that they have to take the name of the entire continent they live in.
	Also see: Canadia
		Example: George: Dear, those damned United Statians make me wish we lost world war II after all.
		Clara: Their ego is probably causing global warming.
		Samantha: They don't even realize that the higher IQ States vote for democrats and lower IQ ones vote for republicans, how can they be so proud of a nation that most of the time is run by stupidity?
		Laurence: [Want some more] weed, George?
		George: Sure. And let's get back to what we were doing earlier, lets not forget men in Canadia get at least three cultured and hot women to do their bidding.
		Women: As you wish, my lord!
		
		________
		
		[Ermanno]: Esos americanos son estúpidos.
		Alejandro: ¡También es! Tiene que decir: estadounidenses. ¡Pendejo!
		Rodriguez: ¡Carabra! ¡Arriba [Riba]! ¡[Tekila]!

	(2007-07-05 +84/-45)
	I just wanted to point out the Spanish word "Estadaunidenses" which is [a real word] (unlike "United Statians") but is the same thing (rather than "Americanos" which is [almost never] used to [mean people] from the USA).
		Example: United Statians are [cool].

	(2007-07-09 +59/-53)
	A polemical term used to describe people from the United States of America. For historic and cultural reasons, people from the States refer to themselves as "Americans", whereas in all of Latin America, the word "américano" refers to anyone from the Americas.  Therefore Latin Americans refer to people from the States as "estadounidenses" (United Statians) rather than "americanos".
	
	Due to Americans [obliviousness] of this issue of [transcendence] in Latin America, a Chilean group has even written a song that describes American mentality when thinking of Latin America.  It is entitled: “Latin America is a town south of the United States.”
	
	Many Latin Americans would like to change the English term "American" to "[United Statian]" and the word "American" to refer of all people from the Americas (North, South and Central). It is an issue heatedly discussed in many forums on the internet.
	
	
		Example: Nick: Why do Latin [Americans] want to call us United Statians?
		Jen: I think they´ve got a bit of an [inferiority complex], I´ve never had a Canadian challenge [my definition] of "American".
		

	(2006-02-27 +818/-2448)
	A word used to describe people from [the United States] without [confusing] them with people from [South America].Also used when the word American cannot be thought of.
		Example: United Statians are some of the luckiest [citizens] in [the world].

		Examples:

Universal Healthcare
	(2010-12-17 +85/-34)
	A system for providing medical attention to people, of which Americans have absolutely [noe] experience, knowledge or understandig of. Yet they have a million strong, [gut] [wrenching] opinions about it.
		Example: American: "Hey i dont want your "socialiced medicine" system in my country! I am an expert on national healtcare systems. [Insurance] companies are the Gods of knowledge and all scientists are retards and Universal Healthcare is communism.

		European: "Ok.. whatever... I'll go and have my free [MRI] tomorrow, and take [my kids] to the doctor for the annual free check."

	(2008-09-11 +158/-85)
	A system under which healthcare costs are shared throughout the community, rather than being [dumped on] one person. Has a couple of big [advantages]: first, checkups and tests, even advanced ones like MRIs, become much more [affordable] and more convenient when you don't need to involve the insurance companies. This lets people catch and treat problems earlier, making things cheaper and easier all around. Second, the overall cost for procedures is cheaper.
	
		Example: Under the [US's] private insurance system:
		[Dental work], $2000
		[Ingrown toenail] surgery, $200
		
		Under Japan's universal healthcare system:
		Dental work, $160 upfront
		Ingrown toenail surgery, $14 upfront
		
		You're telling me that instead of contributing a bit to a group pot, you want to pay obscene amounts of money to a guy who might pay SOME of your bills if you get hurt... if he feels like it, and decides it's worthwhile? Whatever, man. Whatever.

	(2008-09-21 +94/-73)
	A system by which health care is available to all citizens of a country [irrespective] of their ability to pay. 
	
	Sometimes called "[socialized medicine]" it in fact can be provided using a combination of the public and [private sector], compulsory insurance with assistance for those who can not afford it, a system funded entirely by taxes, or both. 
	
	The USA is the only developed country not to implement universal health care. The current system is very expensive and inefficient, people in the USA pay more than anyone for health care in the first world yet receive treatment on par with third world countries.
		Example: [French Man] 1: You hear ze americans have no "universal healthcare".
		French Man 2: [Hoh] [hoh] hoh hoh hoh.
		French Man 1: Hoh hoh hoh hoh hoh.
		
		And so it goes on.

	An idiom used commonly on Facebook by high school and college [dropouts] who secretly regret being unsuccessful at getting [an education], and want to make it look intentional. It supposedly means [that life] is the person's teacher, although most of its students have not learned anything but how to just barely survive while still being able to afford enough alcohol to block the pain of lost dreams.
		Example: [Psssh]! Why [go to school] when I can [get a job] now? I was totally smart enough for school, I just choose to attend the University of Life!

	(2006-09-30 +74/-33)
	Used instead of a real [university] name by people that never [made it] to an university feel [ashamed] because of that.

	An account on Youtube that apparently owns everything. They will delete your videos if they find just the smallest reason to believe you have used material that belongs to them.

You can try to [dispute] the claim, but that will most likely get you banned from Youtube, because almighty [UMG] thinks that it can just go around and pwn everyone and everything. Oh, and don't even think about messaging them, because they won't reply. 
		Example: Universal Music Group: [Oh, no]! Someone [uploaded] a 5-second [clip] of a song we don't own! BANBANBAN!

	(2019-10-04 +14/-0)
	Brainless fucking idiots who think they somehow own all audio on YouTube. Somehow these [braindamaged] cucks get away with falsely striking thousands of videos everyday. God for some reason allows this shitty "company" to exist on earth so unless this scum of the earth goes bankrupt (it won't anytime soon, they're the Ultimate Money [Grabbers]) Youtube's shitty [copyright system] will allow these wankers to continue stealing money from creators.

Universalistic Sun Worship
	(2007-09-25 +134/-26)
	Universalistic Sun Worship is a religion, in which the followers adhere to the 6 principles of Universalistic Sun Worship.
	1. The existence of god is impossible to prove (or disprove) and impossible for a human to comprehend its [true form]; therefore, we give thanks to things we can understand. We [praise the Sun] and the Earth for providing us with life and sustenance. 
	2. The Sun is the source of life on Earth. It provides humanity with food (through farms), shelter (through trees), warmth (through [electromagnetic radiation]) and it allowed [star dust] to combine and form the rock know as the Earth (through gravity). So we give thanks to the Sun, every day.
	3. The Earth, being the second most important object for [humanity's] survival, so it must be protected and maintained for as long as humanity calls Earth home. We also give thanks to the Earth daily.
	4. Humans and animals act based on their beliefs and instincts and since humans have no control over their beliefs or instincts, therefore Universalistic Sun [Worshiper] believes that all living creatures [go to heaven] (or some sort of [afterlife]), are reborn into a new life form, or just die and rot in the Earth. Since it is impossible to know which one is true, it is up to each individual follower to decide which one they believe is true.
	5. The Great Hierarchy must be followed.
	The Great Hierarchy is as follows: The Sun-The Biosphere-Humanity-Animal Life
	The Great Hierarchy generally works as follows: if the Sun is threatened then all things below it must do what is in their power to protect it (although this highly unlikely as the sun is the more powerful then everything currently below it). Next would be the [Biosphere]. If it is threatened then the Humanity must do what is needed to protect it, even if that means the death of some, but never all, of Humanity. Finally, if humanity is threatened, including a single member, then any number of animals can be killed in order to save its life (although killing in excess should be avoided).
	6. All religions are created equally and since any or all of them maybe the true religion of god (if [there is a god]), then no human can rightly say that a religion is bad or wrong. With the exception of religions that have the consequences of the destruction of the Biosphere, the Sun, or human lives. 
	
	Universalistic Sun Worship was founded by Paul Klavins and is subject to change.
		Example: [Paul] Klavins created an [intresting] [religion] known as Universalistic Sun Worship.

	(2009-03-30 +25/-17)
	[A religion] in which followers worship the Sun, because it's [reliable] and nurturing, and far more probable than a [judeo-christian] god. Followers are called athelists.

	All there is. 
	
	This is a [flexable] term, which once was used for what we now call the solar system. Later, it was used for what we call [the Milky Way]. Now it is used for the sum total of all the [galaxies], of which appears to be about ten billion of them.
		Example: The more we [learn], the larger our [universe] seems to get.

	(2005-04-30 +563/-169)
	A unified consciousness experiencing itself subjectively, looking for its reason for absence.
	
	We are solving ourselves.
	
	Each universe within the multiverse is like an [octave] of reality. As we understand there are 7 colours and 7 notes in a scale. There are also 7 levels of consciouness. Each octave of thought is a different dimension/parrallel universe.
	
	We can only [see into] this reality just like we can only see one octave of light. Higher [vibrations] are out of view, and so are lower vibrations. The same goes for sound, only because particles are at much lower energy vibrations anyway, we can hear more [octaves].
	
	Everything is looking to progress from a lower [vibration] to a higher vibration. At higher vibrations everything is less seperate. E.g. The frequency of [T.V's] is roughly 50hz, and so for us it seems [smouth] and one flowing picture. At lower frequencies we can see each individual frame.
	
	The idea is to become more unified. Emotionally, Love and Hate are the spectum of thought. Hate is [seperation] - lower frequencies of thought, love is unifaction - [higher frequencies] of thought. When we hate everything, then we suffer, because as we have hated everything, so everything has hated us. When we love everything, we find bliss, because as we have loved everything, so everything loves us. Very simple, yet so far, our species (humanity) has yet to see this obviousness.
	
	We have had glimpses into the truth of higher, more perfect, realities (known as heaven - which is only a word, the reality is so much more), but due to our misinterpretation of the truth due to our lack of understanding to begin with we have generated a game of [chinese whispers] through religions until our realisation that we were being controlled through half truths and misconceptions.
	
	Understand that these chinese whispers have passed through the minds of [hatful] people that wish to control and [supress] [true knowledge] from us. E.g. [200 years] ago, we were being enslaved by christianity. Now, we broke free from childish interpretations of reality into something much worse. As we developed so did the system.
	
	We are now controlled by governments. Much more organised, much more controlling. Setting aside commandments for laws.
	
	There is only universal law, everything else is just a guideline. That being said, killing someone isn't against the universal law, but it is a hateful act and so the universe balances itself by mechanisms described in Buddhism as Karma. It is important to act as loving and compassionate as possible so as to enjoy everything and ascend in consciousness.
	
	Heaven is simply a higher vibration of reality, Hell doesn't exist. Or, we already exist in the lowest vibration of thought there can be. So this is technically Hell.
	
	God is Love, because love is unified and God is complete as one. Perfect like a sphere.
	
	Aside from all of the above. Most of us forget that we are just beings in a universe, and become so obsessed with our own petty lives we forget [the bigger picture].
	
	The universe is like the [breath of God]. Moving from 0 - 1 - 0... The universe shall expand and contract [from nothing] to nothing. We shall live these lives over and over again.
	
	Though, in higher realities, because our frequency is much higher, so time appears slower. Our thoughts are very much more instintaneous because we exist as energy, so our thoughts are as fast as light. Yet, our thoughts now are controlled on a chemical level, and have to travel through nerves at less than 1/100 the speed of light (possibly even less).
	
	We see things in a linear fashion. We see a begining - the 'Big Bang' and so for us, there is an end - the 'Big Crunch'. But time is just an illusion. When we develop higher understandings of reality, so shall we understand time in a different way. And so we shall forget the past, forget the future, and live completely in the present. The only thing that exists is [the here and now], and so, when we live completely in the here and now, so time has no relevance, and so we find eternity in bliss, through love.
		Example: Science believes the universe to be a probability event. But a probability of what proportion? 1/infinity I imagine. So then, science is obviously underestimating how big infinity really is... this is based on the [uncertainty principle]. That is due to the fact that an [electron] cannot be deteced without disturbance. Basically, inorder to detect it, you need to throw something at it so it will then throw something back so you can see it (give it some energy so that it will become 'excited; so that it will seek to assume its normal state and give off the energy. So as soon as you detect it, you have then given it some energy and so whatever data that has been recorded is instantly  irrelevant because it will be behaving under new circumstances to which it was first detected. Doesn't mean to say an electron is a probablity, it just means to say that science is a probablity. Stupid objectivists!
		
		I think, [Therefore I am]
		
		Matter is merely energy [condensed] to a slow [vibration]. We are all one consciousness experiencing itself subjectively. There is no such thing as death, life is only a dream, and we are an imagination of ourselves.
		
		We are the method in which the universe tries to understand itself. Therefore, if we look to understand ourselves, then we shall understand the universe because if we can understand ourselves then we can see how to understand the universe.

	According to Monty Python (in The Meaning of Life):
	The Universe itself keeps on expanding and expanding
	in all of the directions it can [whiz]
	as fast as it can go
	(that's the speed of light you know!
	12 million miles a second- and that's the fastest speed there is.)
	So just remember next time you're feeling very small and insecure
	how amazingly unlikely is [your birth].
	And pray that there's intelligent life somewhere up in space,
	'cause there's [bugger all] down here on earth!

	A collection of Universes is usually called a 'Multiverse.'

	(2009-01-09 +35/-13)
	[The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy] defines Universe as a very, very big thing. A thing so enormously big that you can't imagine how big it is. A bizarrely huge thing. And so on.
	
	The Universe has 0 creatures, because the universe is infinite and the number of creatures is [finite]. And all finite numbers divided by infinite are so small that it can be rounded to 0.
	
	It has no importation or exportation, because it has nowhere to [export] or from which to import.
	
	It also has no monetary unity and no banks.

University at Buffalo
	(2013-04-12 +60/-15)
	One of the most reputable Public Universities in the country that continues to rapidly rise in the rankings. The school is the PERFECT mix between an academically-serious/rigid school and a [party school]. Very good school for Engineering, Business, Architecture, Sciences and many others things.
	
	It's one of the most affordable Universities in the country and the school is not located in the middle of nowhere like many other [SUNY's] so you rarely get bored. It's also very diverse and has the highest student-satisfaction of any of the main 4 [SUNY] University centers. [The school bus] service is amazing in the daytime but crappy in the evenings and night.
	
	There is three campuses. North/Main Campus is located in the suburbs and is mostly made up of unappealing brick buildings but this is where the majority of the activity is. The South Campus is mostly beautiful historic buildings BUT tasteless tin trailers and [handful] of fugly 60's soviet-style bldgs ruin the [ambience] of it. Oh, and there's the Downtown Medical campus that few have actually been to. Thankfully, the UB2020 plan aims to restore beauty to all of the campuses.
	
	CONS:
	- In a region with crappy weather
	- Many of the older academic buildings don't have cell-phone/data reception.
	- Crappy parking for commuters (especially on [North Campus]).
	- Food in Dining Halls is overpriced.
	- Crappy internet reception at night in the [Ellicott] Dorms-{the main dorms}.

The school offers some of the nations best degrees in Business, Architecture, Medicine, Dentistry, engineering, physics, education, and [social sciences], to name a few. [UB's] athletic teams play in the Mid American Conference and are an [FBS], Division 1 program. The athletic teams are known as the "Bulls", while the schools mascot is "Victor E. Bull". UB comprises roughly 20,000 undergraduates and about 10,000 graduate students. It is the largest university in the Northeast (comprising New England and New York State). Despite the other definition, UB is in fact a prestigious university and is one of the hardest schools to be accepted into in the state of New York. It also has lower admission rates than many competing flagship public schools in the nation.

university of akron
	(2011-02-02 +111/-30)
	The University of Akron is a public university in downtown Akron, Ohio with nearly 30,000 students. Although not the most well-known or prestigious university out there, it does have some highly nationally ranked programs (the Industrial/Organizational Psychology graduate program, the College of Business Administration, the College of Engineering, and The College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering). It is also home to the Archives of the History of American Psychology (which contains materials from some of [psychology's] most famous experiments, like [Milgram's] shock experiments) and the 2010 Division 1 National Champion soccer team.
	
	Although I'm sure this reads like an advertisement, that's definitely not the intent. I'm just a current student who strongly disagrees that this is "the shittiest excuse for a school ever created". The school's not perfect (parking sucks--although it's improved slightly with the opening of the newest [parking deck], they do have some [douchetastic] professors, etc), but the only other urbandictionary entry for the school as of this writing is pretty much a load of shit.
		Example: John [Heisman] coached football at [the University] of [Akron].

	(2010-12-08 +60/-165)
	The shittiest excuse for a school ever created. The only people who attend this school are people who can't get into an actual college. If you go here you are most likely a drug addict or prostitute and will eventually get an STD. The fraternities are widely known for date raping any and every male, female or other (i.e. animal or transgender) that comes within a half mile radius of their house. They are extremely ghetto and at some point you will probably be involved in either a [mugging], stabbing, shooting, [curb stomp], or all out [gang war]. Going to this school basically [dooms] your life into a miserable black hole of poverty, depression and alcoholism.
		Example: The University of [Akron] is the [sorriest] excuse for [higher education] known to man.

University of Alabama
	(2006-08-28 +597/-480)
	A state funded university located in Central Alabama.  It is well known for its beautiful campus, excellent academic standards, attractive coeds, and storied athletics program.  This institution has garnered a great deal of esteem in both academics and athletics, so much so that vacuous simpletons that are wildly [covetous] of said achievements are compelled to go onto websites and use [sophomoric] insults to describe this excellent bastion of higher learning.  
	
	See also: Main cause of [little brother syndrome].
		Example: At [the University of Alabama], student athletes are actually required to not only [attend] [classes], but also be able to pass them.

	(2010-08-02 +670/-579)
	A redneck intellectual backwater. Ranks 10th among the 12 SEC institutions in both SAT and GRE averages. [Mississippi State University] & the University of Mississippi, aka "Ole Miss," rank 11th & 12th. Located in Tuscaloosa, a pathetic peckerwood Wal-Martesque Twilight Zone shithole out near Mississippi and former headquarters of the KKK. Uber obsessed with Auburn and "footbawl," few "students" would know [Proust] from [Proulx] from [Prado]. Its nemesis, Auburn, is another "university" in the state, but it is close to Georgia and Atlanta, with several thousand students from metro Atlanta, the Northeast, the Midwest, the West Coast and Asia who have diminshed the inbred factor substantially - while increasing standardized test averages to something approaching halfway respectable. The University of Alabama female "students" attend classes wearing flip-flops and with their stringy platinum blonde hair haphazardly piled megaskank fashion atop their heads. Male "students" invariably feature "[Bama Bangs]," which makes them appear to have even lower IQs. They speak with accents which make most cringe, as if they are the products of 800 years of inbreeding. Jacked up pickup trucks abound, "Bama" tattoos aren't a rarity and an unsettling percentage of the natives (especially the "Bama Bangs" sporting males) "chew" ([chew and spit] tobacco). The females see these "attributes" as signs of their men not being gay. "He mat be dumbern possum shit, but he's mah my-yun!"
		Example: [The University of Alabama] cheer: "Ramma [Jamma] Belly [Hamma] Row Tah Row! Nah less play sum foot bawl!"

	(2009-12-23 +333/-280)
	University on the Alabama and Mississippi state line. Famous for George Wallaces stand in the schoolhouse door. Fans still slavishly adore the man that ‘rassled’ a little bitty [bear cub], smoked unfiltered cigarrettes, used hookers as a bait and switch and drank [rot gut] whiskey to further his football team as they won over a [clamed] 156 national championships. Has a large percentage of "Sidewalk alumni" who are quick to anger and have trouble expressing themselves eloquently. Known to beat or shoot family members or significant others especially at halftime of games that the Tide is losing. This gives the state of Alabama a high rate of Trailer Park women that fall up the steps. [Donald Fagan] had it right "'They call these cracker assholes this grandiose name like the Crimson Tide, and I'm this loser, so they call me this other grandiose name, [Deacon Blues]?' " Most students drop out after an alcohol and drug fueled football season to an outside sales job at daddy's work.
		Example: I could not get into [Auburn] or [UAB] so my daddy is [sending me] to The University of Alabama.

	(2006-12-07 +361/-313)
	Home of Alabama football and of the most delusional fans in all of sports.  ESPN's Pat [Forde] said it best, "Irrational passion and general delusion don't just [drive the bus] at Alabama. They drive the [wheels off] it like Dale Earnhardt."    
		Example: The mascot for [the University of Alabama] is clearly an [elephant], but they say [roll tide].

	(2009-07-17 +303/-268)
	The most amazing place on earth. The greatest college in the [SEC] and since the SEC runs [NCAA] athletics that makes it the greatest college in the country. It is a place where tradition matters...12 National Championships, 21 SEC Championships, and more bowl appearances than any other team in NCAA football. It's where the great "Bear" Bryant became a football legend. The place where the amazing [Nick Saban] now hangs his hat.
	
	One of the biggest party schools in the country. Everyone has a good time in a visit to the [U of A].
		Example: [Auburn University] [wishes] it was [the University of Alabama].

	(2005-01-31 +271/-265)
	At this University, instead of a [student ID], they issue each student a [mirror that] fits in your wallet and a $[1 bill].  
	
	No need for your driver's license, just use your fake...and bring a koozie, they only got cans.
		Example: "Hey bro, [you got some] white on your nose..."
		
		 " [its cool], its part of [the dress] code at the bar"

	(2003-05-04 +250/-293)
	[The University of Alabama] is a state funded college in the state of Alabama.  Basically, it sucks [donkey balls] for pesos.  They got abandoned by one football coach and then had to fire another because he hired a whore.  Their football team sucks.  They have a mascot of an elephant, yet their battle call is "[Roll Tide]"  What the fuck is a tide?  Are they gonna do our laundry?
		Example: University of Alabama [lost] to [Auburn] 17-7.

	(2011-04-13 +101/-120)
	The premier University in the state of Alabama and located in the town of [Tuscaloosa], aka [T-Town].
	
	Many people who don't attend or who aren't from the south make fun of it, but the fact is the University is extremely wealthy and has an abundance of some of the best looking people in this country (probably due to their high family income and nice weather). Many prominent American families with "[Old Money]" send their children here, as they know they will make connections with similar families and continue the tradition of running this country. It is home to the most [legendary football] team in the history of the game, and has won 13 national championships. Many people like to boast on how their school is better because they have "higher test scores and harder curriculum" and a bunch of crap, when really what matters is not the grades you make but the hands you shake. It is said to be racist, particularly by northerners and [westerners], when the people at [UA] are just strong willed people who love their way of life and would die defending it, whether that be from enemy nations or liberals in the far corners of our own beloved country. Most are of anglo-saxon descent, and their lineage goes back to the founding of this country.
		Example: Sam: Hey Michael, what school are you going to after graduation?
		
		Michael: I think I am going to attend [the University of Alabama]. [Roll Tide]!
		
		Sam: Nice! I guess hooking up with gorgeous women and meeting other wealthy people is worth the [humidity]..maybe I'll go there!

	(2003-11-01 +183/-250)
	a university in alabama known for mediocre football teams and average academics.  the only decent thing about this [clown suit] of a school is that there are some [pretty hot] ass bitches that [hang around] the campus.

University of Arkansas Pine Bluff
	(2006-04-08 +56/-46)
	AKA "UAPB". Branch of the University of [Arkansas] that is located in [Pine Bluff]. This school is highly [negroid], so UAPB also means yoU Are Probably Black.

University of Baltimore
	(2005-05-06 +54/-10)
	A college located in the middle of [Baltimore's] gay district. Recently has opened it's door to freshman and sophmore students, which one would think would lead to more women who are not married/engaged/bull [dikes]. But alas it's just [more of the same], just younger

	2. The [Berkley] of Canada, and one of the top 40 universities in the world. A fact which no one outside of [academia] is really aware of. Usually perceived by Canadians as being among the top three universities in the country. (U of Toronto, [Mcgill] are the other two).

_____

University of Calgary
	(2010-08-31 +53/-31)
	A Canadian University with an extremely large campus but low student enrolment. Its low enrolment is mainly due to the [aging] ugly, [run-down] buildings that are still on campus since the [1950s]. Namely the Buildings that house the Schulich School of Engineering.
		Example: I know [Calgary] is a great city in Canada [but seriously]...this University (i.e. the University of Calgary) is old and [not fit] for humans to be inside.

_____

University of California San Diego
	(2006-04-13 +163/-73)
	Founded in 1960, the University of California-San Diego (widely known as [UCSD])is a high-ranked public research university located in [North County San Diego] in the conservative community of La Jolla. UCSD puts much of its focus and funding into its research depts. and graduate schools. This is good in the sense that it has raised the university to [number 32] in the country in only 46 years, but bad in that it leaves the undergrads without any grand sports events and [frat row], like its sisters UCLA and Berkeley. UCSD has come to the very point of surpassing UCLA in academics, out ranking it in Engineering, [Poli Sci], and Theatre amoung other things. Without a large waste of money on a football team, the campus is sadly decentralized and lacks a reason to come together. In the good ol' days, UCSD was so liberal, that in one instance a student lit himself on fire and died, to protest the Vietnam war. It is inevitable, that in time UCSD will surpass the outdated UCLA, because of its fast climb and focus solely on academics. More students are now choosing SD over LA as well as Berkeley. 
		Example: I got into the three best [UC's]. Berkeley, LA, and San Diego. I could live in a foggy shithole, in a cloud of pollution, or by a ocean bluff...what did you THINK I'd choose?
		
		University of California San Diego: THE SMARTER ONES (taken from a bumper sticker in the bookstore).
		
		Typical [UCSD] weekend: A gust of wind through the eucalyptus [tress] and weird songs from the Singing Tree.
		
		Typical UCSD party: One handle of vodka with 100 tomato-faced asians.
		
		Another typical UCSD party: Bad ass memories of Tijuana and the fuckload of money lost at [Barona].

_____

University of California, Irvine
	(2010-09-11 +65/-29)
	A relatively young, highly ranked school established in 1965 with great academics that is [steadily] rising in reputation. [UC] [Irvine] has one of the highest student populations of Asians at around [52]% in 2008.
	
	Some people still think that [UCI] has no social scene because it is set in the stereotype that it is a "[commuter] school".
	
	Irvine, the city the school resides in, is a very safe and clean (not to mention very expensive) community.
	
	UC Irvine was ranked #[41] in the National Universities category and #11 in the Top Public Universities in the United States by U.S News and World Reports' "Best Colleges 2011" annual rankings.
		Example: [Amanda] was rejected from [the University] of California, [Irvine].

	(2009-11-13 +51/-123)
	UC Irvine is a relatively [young school] within the UC system. It is the fourth-ranked or fifth-ranked campus in the system, after Berkeley, UCLA, [UCSD], or [UC Davis]. UC Irvine lacks a football team and is a commuter campus by nature, meaning a conspicuous deficiency in college spirits. A majority of students are Asians, particularly Asians who got rejected by Berkeley, UCLA, and UCSD. Alumni network on campus is virtually non-existent. While [UCI] may be trying to bolster their academic reputation, students generally hold UCI in low regard compared to the big-name campuses in the system like UCLA and Berkeley.
		Example: Friend: Hey where are u [transferring] to next fall ?
		me: University of California, Irvine
		Friend: Oh, [I feel sorry for you] man. [UCI] sucks.
		me: Yeah I know, but it's the only campus I got accepted.

		Example: [Henry]: "Hey, what school do you go to?"
		Kim: "University of California, Riverside!"
		Henry: "Nice. I heard [UCR] is improving. UCR wasn't a great school [back then]."

University of Casual Sex and Beer
	(2005-02-13 +302/-114)

_____

University of Chicago Laboratory Schools
	(2010-11-06 +120/-60)
	Best school in the country that is not in New York. President Obama sent his kids to the school, and that is just one of the abnormally high status attendees who went to the school. The school is filled with rich snobs who look down at anyone who doesn't have a 4.0 GPA or is mentioned in some article in some famous newspaper about some overachievement. The kids who go there are abnormally smart but they know how to party. They study hard, but they party harder. Abnormally rich parents send their kids to UCLS when they are in Kindergarten so that they are brainwashed so early and don't know anything besides [A+'s] and expensive cars and penthouses. Unless your the kid of one of the teachers. Then your lucky to get in on [half off] the tuition. Whenever you tell anyone you go to UCLS, kids are amazed because they just hear [University of Chicago].
		Example: Random public school kid, "Hey which school do you go to?"
		
		Rich [private school kid], "I go to the [University of Chicago] Laboratory Schools."
		
		Random public school kid, "Whoa you go to the University of Chicago!?!? but your really young!?!"
		
		Rich private school kid, "No dumbass. I'm 15, and even though i skipped to grades, I'm not going to go to college before i can drive."
		
		Random public school kid, "So which district is it part of."
		
		Rich private school kid, "No dumbass, we're not part of a district cuz we're a private school."
		
		Random public school kid, "Whoa you go to a private school!?!? So are you really rich??"
		
		Rich private school kid, "I live in a 2.5 million dollar condo in [downtown Chicago]. and my parents drive 2 new $100,000 mercedes cars, an Aston Martin, and a vintage ferrari. So what do you think.

University of Central Florida
	(2010-05-02 +249/-115)
	University of [Central Florida]
	
	The single best school in the entire world. Without [a lick] of history prior to its founding in 1963, it's already the single biggest school in the country for undergraduates (and third for total [undergrad] and [grad] students). Located in Orlando, Florida, the University of Central Florida ([UCF]) offers its students an incredible variety of opportunities academically, socially, professionally, and visually. Its girls are world-renowned for their beauty, brains, and class, and its men are of such class and excellence that they are the only men worth these ladies' time and affection.
	
	If accepted, it is a life-defining, catastrophically [stupid mistake] to not attend this university. If you are a prospective student, however, you may fear that you won't fit in with such excellent people. However, just getting accepted to UCF typically means that you have a high degree of skill, attractiveness, and luck. Accepting the offer of enrollment proves this.
	
	The University of Central Florida is, again, the best school in the world. Period.
		Example: I received a first-class education in awesomeness at the University of [Central Florida]. My major was [mechanical engineering].
		
		Normally, when people are confronted with a woman of exceptional beauty, they become scared and nervous. [UCF] grads are well-versed in how to deal with such women.
		
		UCF has a Chocolate Club. Seriously, what other information do you need?

	(2011-01-03 +127/-230)
	Considered to be the second largest commuter school in Florida, next to Disney World, [UCF] provides students of all ages (Especially those aged 40+ who never got the chance to go to college) an opportunity to attend and print out a copy of a Bachelor's Degree from their library.
	
	UCF is a model school when it comes to a lack of school spirit. When asked, 50% claimed their mascot to be Mickey Mouse, 40% said it was a horse, and 10% said they didn't know what a mascot was.
	
	Understanding that many of their students commute from either Disney World or their parent's house, UCF has made great strides in ensuring that freshman still receive some form of the "college experience" by promoting and encouraging the "[Freshman 15]," which remains spearheaded by the Greek Life, mainly the sororities.
	
	Originally, [University of Central Florida's] (UCF) intended purpose was to educate students in preparation for employment at Disney World as janitors, but an increase of recent standards by Disney have made it impossible for UCF graduates to work there. In order to accommodate for this, UCF has begun shuffling new graduates into fast food franchises, with the exception of [Chickfila].
	
	While still an accredited school, its status as a university remains questionable. When those responsible for accrediting schools was asked "why," they responded with, "We thought it would be funny."
		Example: Son: "[Hey dad], I only got into two schools. [McDonald's] and University of Central Florida. Which one should I go to?"
		
		Father: "Ok, son, for one, McDonald's isn't a school... but if you're asking me which option will give you more of a future, go to McDonald's."
		
		Person#1: "So did you get into any colleges?"
		Person#2: "[UCF]"
		Person#1: "...So no?"
		Person#2: "Yeah..."
		Person#1: "I'm really sorry"

	Best school in the country that is not in New York. President Obama sent his kids to the school, and that is just one of the abnormally high status attendees who went to the school. The school is filled with rich snobs who look down at anyone who doesn't have a 4.0 GPA or is mentioned in some article in some famous newspaper about some overachievement. The kids who go there are abnormally smart but they know how to party. They study hard, but they party harder.

University of Colorado
	(2008-05-08 +378/-142)
	The University of Colorado has great academics & research.  It is ranked the 11th best public school in the world. CU has the hottest girls anywhere.  Academics are [rivaled] only by the parties. The Hill is where everybody lives and parties. [Pearl Street] has upscale shopping, bars, and street performers. Too many Californians come here and think they own the place.  Everybody gets high. Yuppie-Hippies. World class skiing. EVERYBODY is white (except for a few asians). Denver kicks ass and is only 20 minutes away. Bums everywhere, Norlin 420! Sunny 300+ days a year, The [Flatirons], [GDI] Liberals, Decent Greek System, Nitro
		Example: Are you going to the University of Colorado [football game]?
		
		Maybe, after I [pack] another [bowl].

	Also known as Cunt University. Or the University of Cunts at Ballsack.
	
	If you want to go to a place were the hot girls all drop out after freshman year, the nerdy girls are prude, the [Yippies] (yuppy hippies) are as far as the eye can see and the weed smells and tastes like the [yippies] ass crack then it is the perfect school for you.
	
	So many party's that none of them are quality, unless a stoner guy smoking ganja out of his parents basement is cool to you.
	
	Mascot is pathetic, [buffalo's] suck so bad they were killed and domesticated by barbaric Neanderthals with obsidian knives and arrows. Their skin was used to cover the [floor's] of [TP's]. Were any respectable Indian [Chieftain] spent his whole childhood hunting a ram so that he could come home victorious and a man, he proudly wore the rams fur as a symbol of his power for the rest of his life.

		Example: Friend: Im going to [CU] this year.
		Me: Did you know the [cu] is a Vietnamese word meaning penis, and a [portugese] word meaning asshole?
		Friend: No how did you know that?
		Me: I go to a school were education matters, not money like the university of colorado.
		Friend: Man, i want to go to [CSU] now, the girls are hotter anyway, and the men are....men.

	(2009-11-30 +67/-301)
	11th best public school in the U.S.? OK, because everyone in academia knows that CU-Boulder stands among schools like William & Mary, UCLA, Wisconsin, and so forth. [Last time I checked] out the U.S. News & World Report college rankings, CU was considered the 77th-ranked school in the nation. Right below [Michigan State] (and right next to Harvard of course).
	
	According to the National Center for Education Statistics, CU-Boulder's IQ-range for the ACT is 24-28. That means that if you sit in on a class at CU, there's a one-in-four chance that the kid next to you got less than a 24 on the ACT. That means there's a 25% chance the kid next to you hasn't learned how to tie his shoes or feed himself yet.
	
	Well, excuse me if I'm not blown away by [CU's] imagined prestige.
		Example: [CU] student: Dude, I heard from my cousin from Maine that the University of Colorado is like, practically, the Harvard-of-the-West. Like, we got the smartest kids 'n' everything, and everyone's [dying to go] here.
		
		CU student 2: I thought so bro, let's finish this [bowl off] and touch each other and talk about stuff we don't understand.

The school (student body) is under a spell of [selective mutism] and the professors are home grown indoctrines.   Class is like sitting with some hillbilly [tokers](mainly professors) who talk about the antigoverment and the confederate flag all day.

	(2009-04-01 +34/-17)
	mid sized university located in [Greeley, Colorado] not too far from Denver. Filled with the future teachers, nurses, actors, and musicians of Colorado and the US. 
	
	In comparison w/ CSU and CU which tend to attract many many out of staters from all over the country (many who come for the mountains) UNC is primarily populated by young women from [Denver's] many suburbs (many prospective elementary teachers). Women outnumber men by far. 
	
	Though downtown [Greeley] is very disconnected from UNC and the college culture, there are plenty of college hangouts along 16th street (Maggie's java joint, [Roma's] etc.) 
	
	UNC is surrounded by huge houses, many of them 10 bedrooms which the upperclassmen tend to populate. 
	
	UNC is a blast and no place I'd rather be. 
		Example: [UNC] is incredible. The University of Northern [Colorado] is quite simply everything I [hoped] it would be and more.

University of Dallas
	(2006-11-06 +71/-32)
	A small, Catholic university for independent thinkers, located in [Irving], between Dallas and the [DFW] airport.  Students at UD, as it is abbreviated, engage in a large core curriculum that spans history, literature, philosophy, theology, art, and a few other liberal arts areas.  The school offers majors in any of the above mentioned areas, as well as in the sciences, politics, business, and finance, among others.  Class sizes are small, ranging from 5 to 30 students in each class.  The Rome Program at UD offers the chance to live in Rome, Italy for a whole semester at the University of DAllas Rome Campus.  Students will travel throughout Italy and Greece with their professors giving classes and [on-site] lectures, as well as the [10-day] vacation in which students go wherever they please.  [4 day] class weeks and [3 day] weekends allow the opportunity to travel wheresoever you wish while spending your 4 months in paradise.  Outside the classroom, students' activities are varied.  The Division 3 sports teams play, some are more competitive(ie mens soccer), while others are struggling to get going.  For some, rugby is a religion that many young men convert to when they attend UD.  Rugby plays in [Division 2] and is also competitive.  Those that aren't interested in sports enjoy quieter activities on campus ranging from film festivals to lecture series to other healthy, sober forms of fun.  Many student choose to drink, and underage drinking, along with binge drinking and [marathon drinking] are all extremely prevalent, necessary even, from Thursday to Sunday, with a Monday, Tuesday, and occasionaly Wednesday thrown in.  [UD's] small [undergrad] size(~1300) does not stop its students from partying, and those that want to drink will get a [first rate] training from upperclassmen and alumni that haven't been able to move on after graduation.
	
	Expect a first-rate education and classmates of exceptional intelligence(mostly) at UD.  Also expect those intelligent students to be stumbling around campus at 4am on Thursday night after [TGIT](thank God its thursday) when they have a midterm on [Friday morning].

The students here can makes jokes about about Homer, [Plato], and Dante and no outsider will laugh....ever. Majors include practical studies in philosophy, english, and the classics. The coolest thing is the cap bar! Students here believe "[the groundhog]" to be a sacred animal and dedicate a whole night of drinking to it. Frisbee and Rugby are the only sports people care about. Freshman live in highly stereotyped dorms. Sophomores live in "The New Dorm." [Upperclassmen] live in the glorified dump across the street known as "[Old Mill]." Students look forward to Rome because they can spend the semester drinking and not have to worry about Campus "Safety" Officers catching them. It has a set of core classes that everyone complains about. No Lit [Trad] paper is started until the night it is due. The most beautiful thing about the campus is the tower nicknamed, "the Penis of Las Colinas." Students each in "The Rat."
		Example: A [UD] student will get the joke, "Glaucon likes [the dark ones]."
		
		The University of Dallas is a [bubble] community.

	A small Catholic wonderland located outside of Dallas in a suburb called Irving.

Academics are intense, professors are involved, Deans eat in the campus dining hall, and unlike most colleges- dedicated [monagamous] relationships are cool.
	
	Not to be associated with other religious institutions in the area such as SMU, [Baylor University], or [TCU].

They also enjoy complaining about and firing their head coach.
	
	[Xavier University's] basketball team frequently uses Dayton as its whipping boy in basketball, as Dayton's basketball team has not beat [Xavier's] basketball team in Cincinnati since 1981.

		"That f***ing coach Archie Miller sucks! We should fire that [pissant] just like we fired Gregory, Donoher, and all the rest of those bastards!" - UD Alumni upon hearing Dayton has made the NIT -- again!

	Private University in Colorado that is quite expensive but the skiing,snowboarding, hiking, [rock climbing] and anything else nature related makes up for it (maybe the education, too). We knew what we were going to be paying when we applied, so stop bitching about the cost, or transfer. Yes, you meet a lot of "preppy, [nose in the air]" type of people, but who ever said they had to be your friends? There are plenty of fun people at DU who don't talk about their BMW's and vacation homes...all the time.  
	
	Yes, half the students may look like huge good for nothing stoners, but they probably drive a Range Rover and will own their own business one day (The guy that invented the car boot went to du).
	
	Some of the people suck but the good amount of chill people make up for it. The experience is [what you make of it]. 
	
	The professors are mostly relaxed and some like to bring their dogs to class.
	And you can always find a ride to the mountains.

Far more advanced than any of those other so-called "nationally ranked" Texas schools like TU, or the school with the gaggle of maroon attired morons. The U of H mascot is a fierce predator, and the [University's] hand symbol is "The Shocker," a popular and entertaining sex act.

There is also an AMAZING workout facility, but the majority of students are too busy to utilize it.
	
	One of the most diverse universities in the world; aka 'University of Indians and Chinese'. This is true of both students and faculty. For example, [UIC's] world renowned Engineering researchers/professors are there because they speak the universal language of math, NOT because of needless qualifications such as being able to speak English fluently while giving lectures!

Then after asking staff to give back earned vacation time and cutting the retirement funding, they find [a billing] error totaling more than 15 MILLION dollars. But lets not be harsh because they do have the Iowa Cares program where anyone in the state that doesn't want to work like the rest of us, can come for free healthcare where they can have [room service], treat the staff like shit, and get all the [legal drugs] they want on behalf of the taxpayers. Even better, they can complain about the color of the walls, the rooms being too small, having to share a room, parking is too expensive, they couldn't find a [cheap hotel], and the hospital should be closer to where they live. I could go on and on but I think you get the idea!
		Example: University of Iowa Hospital and Clinics [Staffing] Department hard at work
		
		Staffing: you need 2 [RNs] and 1NA so you are not short.
		
		Unit: yes and if we get 2 more admissions, we will require 1 more RN or we will be short staffed.
		
		Staffing: we probably won't have the NA but we will let you know.
		
		Unit: okay let us know, we have x-number patients that require 2-3 people to turn, potty, etc.
		
		1hr later:
		
		Staffing: we can give you the [RN's] but couldn't get an NA.
		
		unit: okay, what choice do we have
		
		5 minutes later:
		(pager going off)

		We just got 5 admissions, we need another nurse because now we are running short.

Lots of athletes like to come to New Mexico and moan that there is nothing to do...But they need to take a hike!!!! through the beautiful [Sandia] mountains with [the beautiful girls] of Albuquerque who are gracious ambassadors of their city. A lot of the kids who get free college, however, lose their lottery scholarships drop out and become wasteoids who still party with high schoolers. Just by going to UNM, you get mad street cred. However, cops here are super wack and partying is all the time, but very on the DL.

They think they are smarter just because they got into UNC but let me tell you that once you get in there it's not like it's hard to stay there.  I'd like to see them all come to NC State and see how they do in our classes.  Why don't they try to pass our phsyics and chem classes cause I know that they won't be able to.  They don't know anything and what gives them the right to go to [NC State's] free expression tunnel and paint the entire thing [Carolina blue].  They write things on there like "I can't read, thanks state" and "[Baby killers]."  What is up with that, they took away our pride and they have no right to do that.

	The University of [North Florida] is one of Florida's several public higher education institutions. Also referred to as [UNF] it is located in [Jacksonville, FL] and conveniently located near the beaches and the nearby Town Center. The campus is on a nature preserve so wildlife is everywhere--especially [the Canada] geese who never migrate and who pretty much everyone hates (students in [Osprey] Hall on lakeside are particularly vindictive). UNFs current undergraduate student body is around 16,000 as of my last look on their website. They also offer a graduate program and many scholarship opportunities.  Best things to do on campus include sitting out on the Green in nice weather and going to the gym or hitting the nature trails. Things to watch out for: the skateboarders are everywhere and some of them do not watch where they are going and geese poop is everywhere as well.  All in all UNF is an amazing school and anyone who says differently needs to get some more school spirit. Go Ospreys!
		Example: Girl 1: You go to the [University of North Florida]?
		Girl 2: [Yeah I do]!
		Girl 1: What's it like there?
		Girl 2: OMG [Unf] is amazing!

Many parts require renovation.
	
	The football team is also one of the worst in its division. Despite this, they have received funding for a new football stadium. In contrast, the basketball team is fairly good.

University of Okla(HOE)ma
	(2019-11-25 +191/-1)
	This university is full of fucking hoes who fucking love dick. This bitches will be so obvious about their love for cock and their actions will show that they are literally begging for dick. I wouldn't touch any of these hoes tho because their pussies are probably an STD [hive]. If any girl is a hoe, she should 100% come to this university. A common nickname for this university is "[TardU]" but another [good one] would be "[HoeU]"
		Example: Bro, Mia at the University of [Okla](HOE)ma is probably the biggest hoe in [Norman], she is always [acting up] and it's so obvious she wants some fucking dick.

University of Oklahoma
	(2019-11-11 +290/-19)
	A university located in [Norman, OK]. This university consists of the stupidest and most illiterate people you will ever meet. Everyone here has a twelve foot metal rod stuck up their ass. The girls here are straight hoes and will sleep with any guy, the boys here think they are hot shit and are wannabe [fuck boys]. If you ever walked into a class at OU, the class will most likely be empty because everyone skips class everyday since they are lazy and unmotivated and prefer to smoke weed all day. If you ever meet someone who attended this university, just call them an [OU tard].
		Example: A person I was [interviewing] for a job had a [resume] that said they went to the University of Oklahoma, I told them to [get the fuck out] of my office and never come back.

	(2007-09-23 +227/-208)
	A [big 12] college located in Norman, Oklahoma.  OU is mostly known for its football team, which usually does very well. Lesser known to the public outside Oklahoma is the fact that OU boasts more douche bags per capita than any other school in [the continental] U.S. It should be noted that a direct result of this [douchification] is the fact that the university of Oklahoma is OU, instead of UO. And, their mascot is a wagon, which is useful because they need something to carry all of their bandwagon fans who didn't graduate highschool...
		Example: All of the janitors at [my school] are University of Oklahoma [fans].

	(2008-03-03 +139/-127)
	The University of Oklahoma is well known for its football team. This team usually dong-slaps it's in-state rivals, the Oklahoma State Cowboys (who also go by "Pokes" or even "Jokes"), and have very competitive meetings (which they usually win) with the Texas Donghorns and the [Nebraska Cornhuskers]. [The Sooners] are easily in contention for [college football's] national title every year. This, as you can expect, generally translates into an almost cult following by their fan base who use religious terms such as "Patriarch" for coaches and former players and "Saint" for current stars.
		Example: [The University] of [Oklahoma's] football team is easily the 2nd greatest [college football] program of all time.

		Example: If you want to go to a school in a [rural area], with average academics (besides engineering), a dominant [greek life] (if you're not apart of it, forget about partying), and a horrible basketball team - then go to Oregon State.
		
		If you want to go to a good school with great weed, lots of house parties, chill people, and great sports teams [across the board], then go to University of Oregon.

	(2014-06-07 +20/-21)
	[Flagship] [university of Oregon]. [Liberal arts college] that spends most of its money on sports, but does have good programs in business, biology, psychology, and other majors.

University of Ottawa
	(2012-01-07 +71/-71)
	A bilingual university in the capital city of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario. Commonly mistaken with Ottawa University in Ottawa, Kansas by rival school [Carleton University].
	
	Much better school with a higher admission average than Carleton University. Actually has a football team, Law School, and Medical School, unlike [Carleton].
	
	Nice campus in a central, downtown location on most main bus routes within the city. Within walking distance to the Rideau Centre, Byward Market, Parliament Hill, Spark Street Mall and most tourist locations in the city.
	
	Colours are Garnet and Grey, which lead to the choosing of their mascot, the noble [Gee Gee]. The [Gee-Gee], which is the first horse out of the gate in a race, was adopted as the University of Ottawa brand initially to appeal to both the anglophone and francophone student populations. Since the initials “GG” can be used to describe the school colours, garnet and grey, in both languages, the nickname stuck.
		Example: O-T-T-A-W-A C'est [ou] ça? C'est ou ça?
		Université d'Ottawa, l'Université [canadienne]. University of Ottawa, [Canada's] university.

	(2012-10-17 +32/-11)
	Being located in the same city, it is natural that the [University of Ottawa] and [Carleton] have become rival schools. Here are examples of chants heard on the University of Ottawa campus during [frosh week] (also known as 101 week):
		Example: university of ottawa vs. [carleton] rival chants:
		If I had the wings of a [sparrow],
		If I had the wings of a crow,
		I'd fly over [Carleton] tomorrow,
		and shit on those bastards below, below!
		shit on, shit on, shit on those bastards below, below
		shit on, shit on, shit on those bastards below

		Example: I got drunk right before the [SAT], so I had to attend [the University] of [Phoenix].

	(2009-06-11 +508/-96)
	That school you know from spam email. Another diploma mill like [Walden University] or [Trinity Southern University] that [US News and World Report] thinks are below even a ttt.
	
	Their school consists of canned classes and shares most of the content with the other online schools. There is no original thought, their reputation is that of junk mail and no one that you have ever heard of has graduated from there.
		Example: Let's [check me] email today... ...penis enlargement... ...[refinance] my mortgage.... [university of phoenix] wants me to attend.. ..some chick named Susan wants to get it on with me... ..same junk mail, different day.

	(2009-12-23 +305/-167)
	A business disguised as a school that uses spam as a means of [luring] in new unsuspecting customers. This [diploma mill] uses many sneaky advertising tactics, such as coming up as the first result in google search when typing in "university of", TV ads featuring sensationalized stories and fast-paced music, and a YouTube channel that features their "success stories" and that blocks any user that posts anything remotely critical of the school in their videos' comment sections. According to several accounts on the internet, most classes at [UoP] consist of nothing remotely useful. If one is able to get a job after graduating from here and [pay off] the $200,000 they owe in [loans], they are truly lucky.
		Example: Rob didn't want to go to community college so he [enrolled] at University of Phoenix and found himself [shelling] out $[50k] a year to learn absolutely nothing.

		"[The University] of [Redlands]."
		"Dude, that's awesome. Can I come out to one of your parties sometime?"
		"For sure, it's always a good time at a Redlands party."

	(2012-04-21 +32/-90)
	A wannabe prestigious Liberal Arts College in [Redlands], California. The administration claims it's in "Beautiful Southern California," but in reality this unfortunate institution sits in the middle of California's sketchy [Inland Empire] region.
	
	The students think they have the brightest minds on the planet, but the reality is they came to Redlands because they got rejected from their first, second, and third-choice schools. Even though many students do virtually NO work in their classes, the school keeps them just barely passing so their parents will continue [to fork] over that $50K yearly tuition.
	
	Most of the girls are ditzy and overly-tanned, while the guys are too busy getting wasted or showing off in [the weight room] to focus on anything meaningful in life. There are also quite a few useless hippies hanging around. Everyone pretends to be nice, but in reality, they don't give two fucks about you or your life.
	
	Typical Redlands students drink in their dorm rooms or go to lame frat parties on Friday and Saturday nights—because there's nothing better to do on or [off campus]. Or they just go home on weekends to their rich mommies and daddies who make everything better by throwing money at their already spoiled children.
		Example: Attending [the University] of [Redlands] is like throwing $200,000 of your life [savings] into a fire.

	(2006-07-16 +61/-42)

	Arguably the number one [party school] on the east coast.  Was originally listed as the number one party school on [Playboy's] top party school list.  However, Playboy felt it was unfair to continuing ranking professionals with amatuers and removed [URI]  from the list permanantly.

	The state university for Rhode Island which is well-known for intoxicated students. This often makes normal students angry for being percieved as alcoholics because of their not-so-smart peers. Aside from the illegal use of alcohol/drugs the school is cheap in [tuition], with division I sports, a bad football team (where pre-gamers scream "[Rhody] Rhody Rhody in spite of their inability to speak without [slurring]), great basketball team, and everything in between
		Example: [I go] to the University of Rhode Island...
		Oh yeah?
		...........hey man [that kid] goes to [URI]...I think he drinks wayyy to much

	(2010-05-28 +42/-33)
	Public university in Rhode Island, known for its pharmacy program. Essentially a backup school for 80% of Rhode Island high school kids. Filled to the brim with inner-city kids and white guys acting like inner-city kids. Barely manages to keep students on campus because they'd rather go to the beach/their friend's beach [shacks] and get wasted than risk [getting wasted] on campus. The "[party school]" label is something to administration wants to lose, but it'll never be taken away.
		Example: A: Man, University of Rhode Island parties suck.
		
		B: Yeah, let's just go to [Joey's] place by [the beach] and [pound] a few.

	(2004-01-26 +89/-110)

University of Rochester
	(2005-11-15 +305/-78)
	Although located in what many would consider [the armpit of America], the University of Rochester is an institution of higher learning held in surprisingly high regard both internationally and domestically.  Internationally, according to the Times of London, the University of Rochester ranks 73 substantially ahead of many well reputed schools including Dartmouth and admittedly below many of the world's most renowned schools.  Domestically, according to US News, the University of Rochester fluctuates in the low 30's and [high 20's].  Its large endowment and excellent research opportunities make the University of Rochester an excellent [stepping stone] for future admissions into graduate school.  Overall, Rochester is a great place to obtain an education but not such a great place to have a social life.
		Example: Its [fucking freezing] and I'm miserable, thank god I [busted my ass] in high school to get a [1450] on the SAT and a 4.0 GPA so that I could come to the University of Rochester!  

	(2007-08-14 +99/-65)
	Founded in a frozen section of Hell during a blood ritual in [1850], the University of Rochester was born from the womb of Satan.  It has [festered] and swollen ever since.  
	All jokes (sort of) aside, it is a lesser known, yet prominent school in "upstate" New York within the city of Rochester, known for Xerox, Kodak, [Bausch] and [Lomb], and [Genny] Cream Ale.  Though the population of the school is indeed bright, they lack almost all social skills, as can be seen by the half filled sidewalks of the only good bar district (Alexander Street) on Thursday through Saturday night.
	Fighting back against campus authority, the Fraternity quad still stands, though slowly [losing ground] as more and more socially inept student groups take over their houses during times of probation.  Though that would seem to kill off any sort of social atmosphere there may be on campus, it just tends to move students towards smaller groups of alcoholics who either stay in their rooms with their bottles of Mohawk, or venture across the bridge to the frat and other parties off campus where security can't bust them.
	Aside from the few good points of campus (cheap alcohol and good academics) the school is plagued with many shortcomings.  These being : [shitty food], shitty food service workers, janitors that don't do their job, campus security that would rather protect you from yourself when you're drinking than from the person stealing your TV while you're being written up, campus parking that will boot your car on move in day outside your building, as well as 6 months of no sun during the winter.
	With a strong Engineering school, namely their Optical Engineering and [Biomedical Engineering] fields, as well as good psychology, political science and computer science, most students seem to, strangely, gravitate towards the easier majors of Math, Economics or English after a year or two of hard classes.  It doesn't matter much anyway, though, since many students go into some sort of graduate school or get a job not in thier field anyway.
	30 racks of [Keystone can] be found for $13 at [Wegman's] and a [garbage plate] is always a good way to finish the night off.
		Example: Wear lots of layers or drink lots of whiskey, cause you're gonna need something to warm you up.
		
		University of Rochester [parking] is actually Hell [spawn] called upon through [the sacrifice] of those sent to the hospital for "intoxication".  Daemons have to eat, too, you know.

	(2008-10-13 +80/-72)

University of San Diego
	(2005-05-21 +279/-66)
	University of San Diego-a [top 100] university in the greatest city on earth. Often called one of the most beautiful campuses on earth, it sits on top of a hill [overlooking] the ocean and looks like a castle with a huge church built in the middle. With a 2 to 1 girl to guy ratio (rumored to have the 2nd hottest girls ranked by Playboy) and just minutes [from downtown] San Diego and Tijuana, the location of the school is unbeatable.
		Example: Last night I went to TJ, got wasted and took the trolley back to the [Gaslamp] District, [had a couple] more drinks and somehow woke up in [La Jolla].

	(2006-08-18 +231/-77)
	USD, known by students as "Univeristy of Spoiled Daughters", is a prestigious school sitting on top of a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Definitley known as one of the most beautiful campuses in the country, it is rumored that the school spends over $1 million a year in [upkeep]. The school itself offers extensive academic opportunities, with graduate schools in business and law in addition to the undergraduate program. 
	The students all come from extremely wealthy families, and the student parking lots are almost always filled with BMW's and Range Rovers. Closets are filled with [Juicy Couture], Prada, Gucci, and every girl on campus wears Chanel sunglasses. [Virtually all] of the guys on campus surf, and there's always wetsuits hanging over dorm balconies. Students tend to go to either [Pacific Beach] or Mission Beach to party, and most weekends groups of students will head down to Mexico. The school is great for kids who want to be in class one minute, and at the beach either surfing or tanning the next. 
		Example: "[We go] [to school] where you [spring break]."
		
		"Where's that?"
		
		"University of San Diego."

	(2005-06-30 +52/-116)
	Located [on a hill] near Mission Beach in sunny San Diego, this University is known primarily for its upperclass yuppie student body and close location to [Tijuana]. While the campus is beautifully maintained (and the students even more beautiful) this school lacks the diversity and depth needed to [propel] it to the top.
		Example: "Your daughter is rich, snobby, and [bleached] blonde with a bad tan. She'll fit right in here at [USD]. She can park her [Lexus] right over there."

	(2006-04-13 +163/-73)
	Founded in 1960, the University of California-San Diego (widely known as [UCSD])is a high-ranked public research university located in [North County San Diego] in the conservative community of La Jolla. UCSD puts much of its focus and funding into its research depts. and graduate schools. This is good in the sense that it has raised the university to [number 32] in the country in only 46 years, but bad in that it leaves the undergrads without any grand sports events and [frat row], like its sisters UCLA and Berkeley. UCSD has come to the very point of surpassing UCLA in academics, out ranking it in Engineering, [Poli Sci], and Theatre amoung other things. Without a large waste of money on a football team, the campus is sadly decentralized and lacks a reason to come together. In the good ol' days, UCSD was so liberal, that in one instance a student lit himself on fire and died, to protest the Vietnam war. It is inevitable, that in time UCSD will surpass the outdated UCLA, because of its fast climb and focus solely on academics. More students are now choosing SD over LA as well as Berkeley. 
		Example: I got into the three best [UC's]. Berkeley, LA, and San Diego. I could live in a foggy shithole, in a cloud of pollution, or by a ocean bluff...what did you THINK I'd choose?
		
		University of California San Diego: THE SMARTER ONES (taken from a bumper sticker in the bookstore).
		
		Typical [UCSD] weekend: A gust of wind through the eucalyptus [tress] and weird songs from the Singing Tree.
		
		Typical UCSD party: One handle of vodka with 100 tomato-faced asians.
		
		Another typical UCSD party: Bad ass memories of Tijuana and the fuckload of money lost at [Barona].

University of South Florida
	(2005-11-25 +447/-152)
	The University of South Florida ([USF]) is a public university located in Tampa, Florida. [USF's] mascot is the Bull, and its colors are [green and gold]. USF is the third largest university in the state of Florida, behind the University of Florida and Florida State University. USF boasts highly acclaimed engineering and medical programs, and is a first-tier research university.
		Example: The University of [South Florida] is a very [well-rounded] university that doesn't get enough credit because of other state universities such as the University of Florida and [Florida State University] getting all the attention.

	(2011-01-04 +153/-71)
	The premiere institution of higher education in the state of Florida, [USF] is home to the Bulls. Regarded as one of the top three flagship universities in Florida by definition of State Congress (the others being FSU and UF), no other school in the nation has obtained such accelerated acclaim in both the academic and athletic arena.
	
	The Bulls' football program is relatively new. This, however, has not stopped the Bulls from defeating the [Seminoles] (FSU) and the Hurricanes (UM). Due to the Bulls' accomplishments, they are often referred to as the fourth member of the "[Big Three]" in the state of Florida.
	
	Unlike other schools that are often located in the middle of nowhere, USF is a metropolitan university. Besides the amazing parties, students also enjoy [Ybor City's] clubs and bars, the [Busch Gardens] theme park, Clearwater and [St. Petersburg's] world famous beaches, and shopping at the International Plaza and downtown Tampa.
	
	Unlike UF, USF prefers not to have bandwagon fans (people who wear a school's gear without having any affiliation or relation to the school, such as they are not a student or have friends or family who go there). Our gear is sacred and respected. We let the hicks and pretenders wear UF gear.
		Example: The University of South Florida ([USF]) is what every potential student looks for in a school. All of its students engage in top-of-the-line research and earn degrees that are respected internationally. The school's young age provides the opportunity for its students to take part of real history, instead of looking at hallways filled with old [dead people's] portraits like they do at FSU and [UF].

	(2006-01-30 +173/-270)
	The University of South Florida ([USF]) is quite unique. While it prides itself for its exceptional academic programs and medical research facilities, it also is notorious for accepting just about every 18 year old in the state of Florida who got below 1000 on their SATs. Somehow, these students manage to graduate though, even with the distractions of nearby [white sand] beaches, [Gasparilla] (an event that takes up the month of Febuary which can be summed up by public intoxication and the performance of sexual favors), and Ybor city (a strip of clubs that the USF students control). USF has a growing football program with the Bull as the mascot. Although the football players are dedicated and got to attend there [first bowl] game, half of the football players must hold jobs during off season to pay child support. 
		Example: Nothing compares, The University of [South Florida] is founded upon the principles of educating geniuses and retards in one classroom. Throw in a few Mardi Gras beads, [mass quantities] of alcohol, and a bikini and you have the perfect picture of [USF]. 

	(2008-08-01 +108/-229)
	A third tier institution in [Tampax], Florida known for their ridiculously lax admissions standards. They are the third largest "university" in the state of Florida behind [UF] and [UCF]. They recently experienced their best [football season] ever but even that won't attract quality students, as they rank last in the state in number of Merit Scholars. They pride themselves on being the only commuter school in the country with a ranked football team. Recently, administrators at the school announced they would not be able to construct housing for students because of the strong community support for the existing pawn shops and liquor stores that surround the campus. The current money mismanagement crisis at the school has caused students to question the number of luxurious pieces of furniture in the president's office, which include a miniature model of an on-campus football stadium with a [plaque] reading "Someday..." attached. 
		Example: [Ray Ray]: "Dude! Did you get into the Tulsa Welding School?"
		[Tay Tay]: "Nah man. They too selectionative.!"
		Ray Ray: "Oh man. [That's straight] up whack!"
		Tay Tay: "It's ok. I just got a football scholarship to the University of South Florida."

From there you can get arrested, taken to the [Richland] County Jail and can walk to the football stadium for the game the next day if your friends don't bail you out in time. Whoever designed this college and city knew what they were doing. And whoever came up with the mascot -- well, wherever that person is, I'm sure he's still smiling about it. 
	
		Example: Wow, I loved drinking in [Five Points] when I visited [the University] of [South Carolina].

	(2007-04-13 +192/-499)
	The school that likes to think of themselves as the "original" [USC].  Unfortunately, they became [the University] of [South Carolina] in 1906.  Prior to that year, they were known as South Carolina College.  The original USC is the University of Southern California.
		Example: We, the University of South Carolina faithful from the Carolinas, [want to ride] the [coattails] of the more popular [USC] school in California.

	(2009-02-17 +11/-3)
	a tiny school out in the middle of nowhere surrounded by [marines], old people, and tourists. Good if you have a car and unlimited supply of money for gas. The only thing close is Wal-Mart and the [Kangaroo] [gas station]. Watch out for the fox on campus, he'll stare you down.
		Example: Only go to University of South Carolina Beaufort if you wanna get [the hell] away from your parents for a few months, cuz [you won't] like it for [too long].

University of Spoiled Children
	(2006-08-19 +750/-256)
	A term used to describe the university of southern california, because most of its students are, well, spoiled children. Is used most commonly by students/supporters of [UCLA], [Notre Dame], and also people that God gifted with [a brain].
		Example: Mike: So, did'ja hear about [Brittney]?
		Jack: No surprise, she's going to the University of Spoiled Children. Daddy gave her [implants] for her [graduation] just to ready her for it.

	(2007-09-08 +189/-422)
	A nickname given to [USC] by [jealous] [UCLA] kids who couldn't afford USC. 
		Example: [My dad's] movie [bombed] last year, so now University of Spoiled Children isn't an [option]. 

	(2007-01-04 +166/-401)
	An outdated and [cliched] nickname for [USC], the University of [Southern California].
		Example: [USC] was formerly known as [the University] of Spoiled Children, but has [vastly] improved over the past few decades and is now a top ranked and diverse university.

_____

University of Southern California
	(2009-08-11 +124/-59)
	An elite, private research university which boasts some of the best programs in the country, including the prestigious School of Cinematic Arts and School of Letters, Arts and Sciences. [USC] has top-20 programs in film, engineering, english, and law. Overall, USC ranks just below rival [UCLA], however that is projected to change by 2012, and USC has been climbing the national ranks since being named Time "School of the Year" in 2000.
	
	2009-2010 admissions to the university are extremely tough (23% acceptance rate versus [UCLA's] 21% acceptance rate).
	
	USC boasts incredible sports teams, including football, where they have won [the Rose Bowl] three times since 2000 and a national championship in 2004. USC also has 12 national baseball championships.
	
	USC is extremely expensive, but has a higher salary rate after graduation than UCLA. USC is also a better choice for [entertainment industry] jobs, as USC students have higher field interview records than UCLA students. USC believes in a "Trojan Family" alumni network which give students a much needed advantage to find work in Los Angeles after graduation.
		Example: "University of Southern California, [home] of the [Trojans]"

	(2005-02-13 +573/-339)
	Centrally located between Watts and Beverely Hills, the University of Southern California is the home of the Trojans, Fuck the Bruins!!!  USC is also home to the rich and select poor kids on scholarship.  Also known as the University of [Sexy Chicks], this is a ridiculous misnomer, but at least our bitches are hotter than the ones cross-town, Fuck the Bruins!!! The weeks consists of sleeping through classes and eating "food" in the on campus cafeterias.  The weekends are filled with [sausage-fest] parties, unless you happen to be a frat boy.  And let's not fail to mention the soon to be [three-peat] national football champs. Also see UCLA sucks at everything.
		Example: The University of [Southern California] [Trojans] fucked the Oklahoma [Sooners] 55-19.

	(2011-11-22 +46/-32)
	[University of Spoiled Children]. But really, only the most pampered students attend [USC]. Everyone knows that the amount of wealth and power amassed at USC is just incredible and rivaled by only few other elite colleges in the U.S. Weather you are insanely loaded or insanely gorgeous USC has it all. No wonder why USC is a top ten international "[dream school]" for applicants around the globe.
		Example: Did you hear that [Tina] got into [the University] of [Southern California]? Yea, I heard her dad like donated $50 million so that she'd be accepted.

	(2006-01-05 +416/-363)
	Every year, [the London Times] ranks the best colleges in the world. In the most recent edition of the Times Higher Education Supplement, [UCLA] was ranked [number 26] in the world. Cal was ranked number 2 in the world. Stanford was ranked number 7. Where do you think [USC] was ranked in the world? 
	
	USC was ranked number 180 in the world by the London Times! I guess your entrance requirements aren't helping you much. 
	
	US News had UCLA ranked at number 25, Cal ranked at number 21, and USC ranked at number 30 for this year. That's because they consider the amount of money alumni give to each school. Of course private schools like USC will have inflated rankings in the US News guide. And even with that, UCLA is ranked higher in the US News list.
	
	Let's see here...UCLA-26, USC-180...USC better in academics? Please! 
	
	It's a known fact that UCLA looks at more than just your scores when selecting students. Ask anybody who's been turned down by the school. You need extracurricular activities as well as high gpa and SAT scores. 
	
	And to the moron who talked about not paying $30,000 a year, if you are [getting that money] in loans, you will be paying it sooner or later. Maybe they didn't teach you that in South Central. I hope the Trojan alumni give you a nice job.
	
	Congratulations on your freshman class. It's too bad that most of [SC's] student body was rejected by UCLA and had to settle for the old private school in the ghetto. I'm sure USC owns Stanford too because USC has a better football team than Harvard.
		Example: UCLA Anderson is ranked 14 and USC Marshall is ranked 27 according to [Business Week]. UCLA Anderson is ranked 11 and USC Marshall is ranked 26 according to US News.  What about undergraduate business? Sure UCLA does not have an undergraduate [business major], but it has business economics.  Harvard and Stanford have a business major? WRONG.  Please don't tell me University of Southern California will be a better preparation for a business career than Harvard or Stanford.  Many Ivy league students who go into [investment banking] major in economics.  According to US News, UCLA Economics is ranked 11 in the nation, and USC is not even in the top 25.

	(2004-11-03 +453/-252)
	the greatest place on earth.  spend on your money to get drunk, eat crappy [cafeteria food], and do a shit load of work.  The place where matt [leinart] and [reggie bush] run the school. yeah..you all wish you were trojans!

	With over eighty countries represented in the student body, children of incomprehensible means from Latin America, Europe, and Southeast Asia attend this [Jesuit] institution, and pay tuition on par with Stanford or an Ivy League school. These students are frequently seen driving Lamborghinis, Aston [Martins], [Porsches], Lotuses, and BMW's, and carrying purses made by Prada, [Jimmy Choo], and [D&G]. Instead of studying, they can often be found congregating in VIP sections of clubs such as Ruby Skye, running thousand-dollar-plus tabs on a regular basis. Spoiled is interchangeable with snotty or snobby, as in the University of Snotty/Snobby Foreigners.
	
	Also known as the University of San Francisco.
		Example: I went by the University of Spoiled Foreigners today, and saw someone's Ferrari getting [towed] for parking in front of a [fire hydrant]. I left just as he started throwing a temper tantrum in front of the [tow truck], but it was pretty funny watching him throw his iPhone in disgust. I guess Daddy is getting the bill for this.

		Example: The University of [Tampa]...we [pregame] like you party and we live where you [spring break]!

	(2008-01-21 +128/-233)
	University of Tampa nestled near the [Hillsborough] river, just west of downtown Tampa is a small private university.. now to the truth, this extremely overpriced, mediocre university in chock full of out of state rich students who are not smart enough to get into a prestigious private university. Due to the small nature and the fact that female students outnumber their male counterparts, this school has quite a reputation for manswapping, gangbanging females. If you like your girls wild and rich, this is the place for you! Best part, if they dont have room for you on dorms, they will [put you up] in a nearby hotel! Quite simply, UT is a more expensive, less adequate alternative to the nearby [University of South Florida].
		Example: The famous saying about [the University] of [Tampa]... "You can't spell slut without [UT]"

	(2011-04-25 +14/-67)
	For some reason students find [falling out] of [chairs] to be uncontrollably funny while regular human beings see the act as a sick [injustice]
		Example: Haha look at the guy that fell out of [the chair] in [the quad] at the University of [Tampa]!

	(2009-05-01 +84/-202)
	The University of Tampa is a small school in Florida that is comprised of students who got rejected from their number one schools. It is conveniently located right outside of [Ybor city], probably the scrubbiest street in the country. There are too many Guidos and Gays to fathom, and [Greek life] is a complete joke. The teachers have the least qualifications of any private school in the South. All of these things may be reasons for [the transfer] rate at 48% after freshman year.
		Example: All the girls are bringing their [Baby Phat] bags to class today, only to impress the [Guidos] at the University of [Tampa].

The school is also known as a regular on Playboy's top 10 party schools. 
	
	Basically, UT is the balls, aside from being in a really bad city, Knoxville. 
		Example: Dude, I wish I had never gone to the [University of Florida], [University of Tennessee] is [where it's at]. What the fuck was I thinking? 

	(2005-11-18 +100/-145)

	Students come to Pacific for small class sizes and friendly faculty. At Pacific, the individual is treated like one, and never as a number. Furthermore, Pacific depends mainly on it's Alumni, and they are very supportive of the University. The Pacific family is one of the best because they always look out for each other. Indeed, a Dean from the dental school once said, "While you are here only for a few years, you are an alumnus for life."
		Example: Student: I want to go to a small University that has small class sizes and great [aesthetics].
		
		[Counselor]: Have you considered going to University of the Pacific?
		
		Student: Yeah, but does it have connections after you graduate?

	(2009-04-17 +274/-273)
	I wonder if those guys talking shit got accepted by [UT]. Sure sounds like theyre the ones in Ivy League schools. UT is actually a Public Ivy. Its impossible for UT to be an ivy league university being that the ivy league is in a specific demographic location. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Ivy
	
	What do [aggies] and [longhorns] have in common? They both applied to UT.
	
	I would talk about Tech but theyre tier 3 and were on the brink of losing the title of "university" this year so I'll leave them out for their own good- "Get your grades up"
	
	
		Example: The original eight Public Ivies list by Moll:
		
		    * College of William & Mary ([Williamsburg, Virginia])
		    * Miami University ([Oxford, Ohio])
		    * University of California
		    * University of Michigan (Ann Arbor)
		    * University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
		    * University of Texas at Austin
		    * [University of Vermont] (Burlington)
		    * University of Virginia (Charlottesville)

	(2011-12-19 +84/-105)
	University of Texas: A large state flagship university located in Austin, Texas. Enrollment = ~50,000. Metro population 2011 = ~ 1.6 million.
	
	1. A once great school that has become a corporation. An institution that has left its roots and mission to pursue the almighty dollar to the detriment of the people of Texas.
	
	2. A school rightly loved by its alums and adored by millions of Tshirt fans than can't read past the sixth grade. Note: Things about [UT] that are thoughtful that will usually by an [alum]. The junk by a tshirter.
	
	3. A school that high performing TEXAS kids from [upper middle] income suburban homes can rarely hope to get into. The dorks in this [socio] economic group are [going to Texas] [A&M], the [partyers] are going to Texas State and the independent "I'll do my own thing' types are going to Tech.
	
	4. Most alums of UT that graduated in the 70's, 80's and early 90's from upper middle class suburban Texas would not be allowed in today. UT would have to give grant and funds to the very demographic its left wing leadership despise.
	
	5. Has [the UT] leadership even thought of what is going to happen when many future alums are from Bangalore, India or Beijing China. Are they going to attend UT games, donate money to the school , go to a UT game today. [UT's] 100,000 fans make less noise than [aTm's] 80,000 and less than Tech' 60,000. You know why. UT fans are old and stale.
		Example: [Plano]: What do you mean I cant get a grant for going to the University of Texas. WTF I got accepted to Rice but UT is not offering a dime. So, I live in Plano and [my mom and dad] make 100,000 a year. Tech is offering a [full ride] and aTm is giving me two years but UT nothing.
		
		Beijing, China. "Mother I have been accepted to the University of Texas". Yes, son it will be very expensive but we will have help paying for it. Will you bring me back a cowboy hat.

	(2016-03-23 +34/-38)
	A large, public university located in the city of Austin.
	
	Commonly referred to as [UT].
	
	The only thing larger than the size of this school may be their ego. UT students think they are the best school in the state, and greatly look down upon [Texas A&M]. Many UT kids believe that the A&M students are just UT rejects, but in reality the [Aggies] are the ones who got accepted into both schools and chose the one in which provides a great education, a humble and friendly group of students, and an overall more welcoming and safe environment. Plus, [Maroon] beats Burnt Orange any day of the week.
		Example: Me: I'm going to Texas [A&M].
		Longhorn: you must've been rejected from the University of Texas.
		Me: Actually I was accepted into the University of Texas. It was my [fallback school] in case I didn't get into A&M. Now please, go change out of that burnt [orange shirt] before I stab a fork into my eye.

	(2006-05-17 +364/-564)
	A school for people pathetic enough to [rave] and brag about their [school's] athletic programs on urban dictionary as if their university is a part of their identity. Seriously, [get a life].
		Example: University of Texas students are [a bunch] of [soulless] [red necks].

	(2006-11-08 +216/-372)
	the largest university in Texas.  Due to the [10% rule] and relatively good academics, many [high school seniors] apply here as a [safety school].  It is probably the largest safety school in the South because they weren't able to get into a private, often Ivy League, school instead.
		Example: Student: Hey where are you going to school next year?
		Future Texas student: Well, I didn't get into [MIT] or [Yale], so i guess I'm headed to the University of Texas. At least they have a good [football team]...

	(2010-12-08 +129/-224)
	1. A school known primaryily for its football, though it has three less national titles than it's superior rivals Oklahoma.
	
	2. A school embarrassingly [immune] to logical or coherant thought, most exemplified by the [God-awful] nickname of it's mascot, [BEVO]!!!
		Example: Guy 1: God, who thought [Bevo] would be a good name for a [mascot]?
		
		Guy 2: The University of Texas.
		
		Guy 1: [Oh, well] that makes sense now.

	(2009-03-06 +217/-437)
	University of Texas is for rejected IVE league-wanna-be-bound Students who had to resort to [a fallback] school whose colors are burnt orange( being the colors babies shit out their ass), with a mascot being a cow (should we be shaking of fear?)-way to represent the state of [Texas guys]. [A&M] has a dog that could possibly have an aggressive aspect to it, and thank god at LEAST one of the Texas schools represented in the big12 has a mascot with a GUN huge props [TEXAS TECH]. 
	
	In the middle of a [city, the] campus is [stacked up] upon itself purposely so students who are hippie-mary [j smoking] freaks have something to look at while discussing their liberal beliefs in the conservative southern part of the country. HEY smart asses, if you all were so smart why didn’t you just go up north and bitch about liberal politics up there? Oh wait you WERENT smart enough to go there that right, my bad.
	
	 All the fruits attend this school in hopes that it will boost their ego and self esteem.-when it wont. Just makes them look even gayer.
	
	Texas thinks they are the shit. Even though this past year the only team they couldnt beat in football was [Texas tech] university- way to get owned after all [yalls] shit talking HA. [UT] students think they are so smart-especially when they dare to consistently make fun of other schools such as A&M and TexasTech for example; ranting about how low their grades are and hope stupid they are when in REALITY there’s probably more STDs floating around UT Campus due to the anal-hippie-lovin-gay-sex, then what goes on up in [Lubbock].
	
	 And oh wait, sorry Other Texas schools don’t suck cock for good grades and money to stay at UT.
	
	UT is over rated. they need to get the long horns that are so stuck up their ass its causing stupidity due to glorifying their cult of orange shit-cow praising-anal fucking 'AWESOMENESS' YOU go UT woo!-Not.
	
		Example: Jim: Hey man where you go to school that allows me to wear colors that [babys] [shit out] their ass and so i can be a snobby cock-sucking homo?
		
		Bob: dude University of Texas all the way man. its the biggest over rated school EVER. best part. your mascot is a cow. 
		
		Jim: [UT] BOUND!

University of the Philippines
	(2011-03-26 +200/-351)
	The overrated state [university of the Philippines] where conceited people pretending to be poor study and live off the national budget for education.
	
	The school is infamous for its dark, dangerous streets, its communist teachers, and its [derelict] [facilities].
		Example: I istady in da University of the Philippines. My [breyn] more intelidyent dan ol [yor] breyns poot togeder so suck my [ghetto dick]!

	(2012-12-22 +38/-165)
	The [premiere] university in [the Philippines] home to the Philippines' best students. People usually attach negative connotations to this university on [the grounds] of ignorance and close-mindedness.
		Example: I am not from [Ateneo], I am from [the University] of [the Philippines].

_____

University of Toledo
	(2005-02-20 +170/-180)
	The University of [Toledo], located in the [sprawling] urban slum of [Toledo, Ohio] offers students a waste of their college years.  Offerring an intensely limited array of majors, advisors and professors strive to either fail their students, or mess up their schedules just enough so that students will have to "enjoy" an extra year at this excellent university. Admission is not based on academic excellence in high school, but whether or not you can pay tuition.  As an added bonus, every student graduates with a minor in ebonics.  
	
	Graduates leave with the warm memories of foreign people teaching Comp 1, BET blasting on all of the TV sets in the Student Union, AVI eggs that look like [sponges], squirrels that are bigger than great [danes], and the knowledge that now they don't have to worry about the "[parking nazis]" anymore.
	
	If this school sounds like what you are looking for in higher education, ask your self these questions:  do you like rap?  do you like living in the ghetto?  do you mind driving around in circles looking for a place to park for at least an hour?  do you believe in [Title 9]? do you like not seeing the sun for 11.9 months out of the year?  do you prefer to waste your youth away?  Then this is the school for you!
		Example: You know you go to the University of Toledo if the only things there are to do are [get mugged], get jumped, [get shanked], [get bored], or get drunk.

	(2005-04-20 +103/-120)
	A [poor excuse] for a post-secondary school. While located in the nicest part of central-city [Toledo] (that ain't saying much), it still cannot deny its strong ghetto heritage. It is a very diverse school that is pretty representative of Greater Toledo (which can be a plus) with lots of Arabs, Blacks, and Latinos. The school is however open admission and will take any retard that can find money for tuition. It has earned its nickname "[Bancroft] High" fully.
		Example: "Man, I don't know what I want to do with my life....I think I'll just go to [UT] and [get high] and hit up the clubs downtown."
		"Brother, you'd be better off with a [St. John's] degree than one from UT."

	(2005-01-04 +52/-79)
	[Toledo's] apparent premier campus offering education in all subject matters especially Engineering, Business, and Law. Meant to drive every commuting student [enrolled] crazy by failing to provide sufficient parking. Also, foreign students and minorities make up the majority of this ghetto [slum].
		Example: Person A: "Where [you going] to [college bro]?"
		
		Person B: "not [Toledo]"

	(2004-12-08 +127/-134)
	[university of Toledo] an awesome university set in the city of [Toledo]. Offering 20,000 students access to high ranked sports, the arts, and tons of clubs and organizations there are countless ways to get involved. It’s an education not just in academics but in real life experience - [UT] has it all!
		Example: [UT] has a lot more to offer than that school down I-75, including a [MAC] [Champion] title for the 2004 season:)

	(2012-03-08 +32/-41)
	Cool school in [Toledo] Ohio. Campus is Huge and is ranked as one of the most beautiful campuses. if your on campus and drive [one way]. your in a rich neighborhood. drive the other way and its pretty dirty and ghetto. but overall [pretty nice] college
		Example: Billy:Bro should we hang with the [millionaires]? or [smoke crack] in the ghetto?
		
		John: Why don't we do both? were at the University Of [Toledo] so its all cool
		
		Billy: Alright!!!!!

University of Tulsa
	(2009-01-25 +60/-39)
	The best damn university in the mid-west! Basically the [Harvard] of the mid-west! It [dominates] state schools and many other [private schools]. We have the happiest students in the country!!!
		Example: Derek: Do you have fun at school/get a really good education?
		
		[Morgan]: DUHHHH!!!! I go to the University of [Tulsa]!!!

	(2009-05-04 +22/-49)
	A small private university, filled with kids that represent the "TU special" or an odd collection of people who were too good to go to state schools. The school also possesses one of the [creepiest] school mascots costumes in Division [1a] [athletics]. The school is generally considered to over-priced and its students arrogant assholes.
		Example: Drew: Hey guys! I'm the [TU] special, but im also a part of ka!
		
		Jacob: so your [socially handicapped]?
		
		Drew: Yea You Know it! But thanks to the university of tulsa my [troubles] will continue!

University of Utah
	(2009-11-25 +233/-146)

		Friend: Party? We're in [Utah].
		
		Student: Oh yeah, well I guess we can study for class.
		
		Friend: [Why bother]? A degree from the University of Utah is ignored outside of Utah, but not needed inside Utah where you can easily get a job from one of your four thousand [uncles].

	(2005-11-18 +303/-402)
	[Utah's] first [institute] of higher learning. Utahns that choose the U of U over lesser schools in the state tend to display the ability to think for themselves and function outside of the State of [Utah].

	(2008-08-14 +232/-372)

	(2005-09-13 +88/-316)
	Only the coolest college in [Utah] where a bunch of people come from [out of state] for no other reason than its a damn cheap school.

	See definitions for [UVA], as [the Va]. [Tech] students who made those definitions struggled with the spelling of "university".
		Example: I go to the University of Virginia, and we really don't have anything against people who go to Va. Tech.  However, they seem to [dedicate] their lives to [fueling] this [one-sided rivalry].

	(2008-03-26 +48/-46)
		
	"Just about every other school in Virginia likes to bash [UVA] kids for being 'pretentious' and 'snobs.' In other words, they get called out for thinking they're better than everyone else.

University of Warwick
	(2011-12-02 +54/-6)
	The university of taking your money whilst shoving its fist up your arse.
	
	Believes that every disciplinary matter should be solved by issuing the student with a [hefty fine] (regardless of blame), and that every item sold on the campus should cost at least twice as much as anywhere else.
	
	Also believes that by making students pay £450 for a year's parking permit, the university is somehow going to single-handedly save the environment. (this is a [load of bollocks] - the money goes to fund the [VC's] collection of Bentleys).
	
	Amusingly, the VC's name is Nigel Thrift.
		Example: I was charged £1.30 for a [bottle of water]. Got anally [fisted] by the University of [Warwick] again.

	(2005-05-29 +62/-29)
	A British campus university. Based, rather confusingly, just outside of Coventry and 10 miles away from Warwick, nearby towns include Leamington Spa and Kenilworth.
	
	Academically sound (apart from Theatre Studies), socially inept and more corporate than Starbucks. But it's rich.
	
	Very large Students Union, lots of [waterfoul] and a higher proportion of international students than is probably necessary. But they're rich too.
	
	American [Vice Chancellor] who wants to take over the Far East and redefine himself in the image of [Blofeld] before he leaves; but that's OK because he's (probably) richer than everyone!
		Example: Interviewer: "Why did you choose Warwick?"
		[Interviewee]: "Because [Oxbridge] didn't [choose me]! *sob*"

	(2005-11-30 +16/-126)
	A university of [socially inept] people who definitely can't ski (hence why they lose to [Loughborough] at every ski race). People who lack banter and often can't speak English. Trying to be a university but is just a small college in [Coventry].
		Example: [Wipeout], a student at the University of [Warwick], a socially inept student with no skiing ability and [no banter] is a perfect example of the classic 'warwick student'

University of Washington
	(2009-05-28 +376/-198)

	(2011-04-03 +353/-265)
	A university located in the city of Seattle and in the state of Washington. If you take away the Medical program and its graduate schools, it's basically just a larger version of a community college.
	
	The [undergrad] students (AKA Fuskies or [Dawgs]) [comprise] mainly of Asian-Americans, foreigners, and spoiled white kids who cannot properly function well in life if living anywhere 20 miles farther from their parents. Others include smelly hippies, unhealthy North Face wearing chicks, male homophobes who are stuck in [mid-90's] era A&F styling, friendly fags, cranky dykes and occasional African-Americans from the sports teams.
	
	The majority of these class-less kids are delusional idiots who thought they could get into [UC] [Berkley], Stanford or some east coast Ivy League school back in high school, but ultimately got rejected on many occasions. As a result, they make the mistake that their undergrad education at [UW] is far superior than anyone else, but in truth is comparable to any community college in the Seattle area. The students also suffer from a "superiority complex" in which they exaggerate their self-worth, [bloat] their egos, stroke their friends' egos, act elitist and poke fun at other [PAC-10] schools because it makes them feel better when mommy & daddy is not around to boost their self-esteem with cupcakes every morning.
	
	Campus is dangerous with [muggers], thugs and rapists.
		Example: University of Washington on campus student clinic...
		
		Doctor: "I hope you are taking [your birth] control pills."
		
		Female [UW] Student: "I make sure I take them every morning"
		
		Doctor: "You are a GREAT [humanitarian]."

	(2011-08-12 +312/-233)
	A school in the PAC 12 most well known for being hated by the rest of the world. The University, AKA UW, is full of high-class-wannabes and stuck up individuals. Commonly known as [Huskies], Fuskies, Dawgs and [Purple Penis] Eaters attendees of the University of Washington are widely considered helpless or "[off the deep end]." Of course no Fuskie will admit this, they would rather brag about their new tan, the school's bad football team or their father's BMW.
		Example: Amanda [Knox], Tend [Bundy] and Angie [Mentink] are just a few of the most well known University of Washington attendees.

	(2010-06-08 +461/-371)
	A state run program to harbor all foreign nationalities, but mostly Asians. Asians, Asians, Asians and more Asians. [UW] propaganda attempts to make attendees (AKA Fuskies) feel better about themselves by inflating their enormous egos by [supplying] pink t-shirts, 2 sizes to small, to all men and by confiscating all female underwear (most girls are already so slutty, they often have none already).
	
	Luckily, UW alerts the general public of a Fuskies presence by [smothering] its inhabitants with gaudy purple and gold, which are the universal colors for "Yes, I tan and go to Starbucks every day, please key my car."
	
	Sadly, while UW was intended for [foreign exchange] students, unintelligent, insecure, high school sluts and bisexual men from here in America have, over time, been attracted to UW, thus enhancing [UW's] reputation as a breeding ground for STD's, bad sports teams, and cum spiked hair.
		Example: [Kieth], you Fuskie, [get up] [to the] University of Washington.

	(2010-11-24 +465/-378)
	The school Ivy missers attend to make themselves feel better about that Cornell rejection. Convinced they attend an elite institution, [Huskies] overlook [UW's] 75% acceptance rate and mediocre admissions statistics, preferring to [delude] themselves into believing they attend anything more than a mediocre regional school unknown outside the Pacific Northwest.
		Example: [Husky] - "Yeah I go to University of Washington, the best school in a barely populated region of the country. It's basically the equivalent of [Harvard]."
		
		[Ivy Leaguer] - "......what the fuck are you talking about?"

	(2011-10-14 +224/-175)
	[Faggots] who [wear] [purple].
		Example: University of Washington [colors]: "[Purple]" and [Gold]

	(2005-03-10 +658/-671)
	The hottest college on the planet. Where the [Huskies] [roam] in Romarville. Where you go if you want to be smart as well as sexy. Home of the purple and gold. So if you see someone [sportin] it they're probably smarter, sexier, better, and more important than you.
		Example: "Look at that Wazzu grad. bag that [UW's] [grad's] groceries. Must be [cougin it]."

	(2009-03-06 +299/-388)
	AKA: [UW]
	
	Best school in the Northwest overall when it comes to academics and student body. An Awesome campus right in [the Emerald City].   Students at UW are hot, smart, chill, down, and friendly. Great diversity, athletics, programs, faculty, and the [hottest girls] in the Washington state.  Guys who go here are lucky. 
		Example: Guy 1: Hey man, I got into the University of Washington!!!
		
		Guy 2: Aw you lucky bitch, they got the hottest girls in the Pac 10.  I wish I were you.
		
		Guy 1: [Don't trip] bro, [keep it pushing] and you'll eventually get in.
		
		Guy 2: Fuck ya! I'm about to be [a Husky]!!! 

	(2009-05-28 +66/-98)

University of Waterloo
	(2010-02-10 +771/-291)
	(noun) [UW] for short. A large collection of nerds [big enough] to promote [misleading] facts about the actual intelligence of the average person belonging to that collection.
		Example: Kevin: I'm going to study math at [the University] of [Waterloo] after I [graduate] high school because it's renowned for its math program.
		
		Jake: Being a nerd doesn't mean you're intelligent Kevin!

	(2022-05-01 +17/-3)
	(aka. "University of Wokerloo", "UWokerloo" or simply "UWoke")
	
	If you want the [wokest] education in the North American continent, look no further. We have it right here at the University of Waterloo. UWaterloo has established a decades-old reputation for being the undisputed intellectual [hothouse] for future Wokers and Woke leaders alike, whatwith all the misguided hypocritical liberal-political hogwash that started here.
	
	In other words, if you're looking for academic success here, you will only succeed in getting your [brain fried], drained or washed by the pretentious clowns who are there to give you the "waterloo" of a lifetime.
		Example: "The University of [Waterloo]: Ideas Start Here" (followed by an [uproar] from the [social justice WARRIORS]!!!)

	(2005-01-02 +803/-591)
	A horribly overrated, poorly located, atrociously designed school.  It's only strength lies in it's engineering prowess, specifically the fields of electrical and [computer engineering].  Any student who attends this university for any reason other than engineering is blind to the fact that they are utterly wasting their time and money.  
	
	[Waterloo] kids constantly remind anyone who will listen that the school enjoys a healthy relationship with microsoft as a "secret recruiting ground" because that ancient fact is essentially it's only claim to fame.
	
	Students of the school also enjoy making reference to a horribly [overdrawn] exaggeration in that the school is "[The MIT] of the North", possibly because they are really stupid enough to believe so, or because they have been shut off from the outside world because of the school's horrendously unfavourable location.
	
	In reality, among Canadian universities, the school sits comfortably in the middle of the pack.
		Example: friend 1: So, I'm going to [U of T] next year.  What about you?
		
		friend 2: I was accepted at [Waterloo] for math, so I'm definitely going there.  It's a Canadian Ivy!
		
		friend 1: Sometimes I can't believe [we're even] friends.

	(2003-08-06 +822/-818)
	The [M.I.T] of [the Great White North].
		Example: University of Waterloo is one of the top [ten] [research] [universities] in Canada.

	(2005-06-20 +536/-718)
	Ranked by [Maclean's] Magazine as the #1 University in Canada.  Major Faculty is [Engineering]. Located in the City of [Waterloo, Ontario].
		Example: University of Waterloo just up [the Street] from [Wilfrid] Laurier [High School]

	(2009-10-27 +356/-578)
	The university of choice for a Canadian degree in Mathematics, Engineering or a Double Honors Degree. Entering average >90% (exceeds 90% for those that attend [U of T] and cannot understand mathematical symbols). Students who attend the University of [Waterloo] will graduate with a degree, knowledge and a career. U of T graduates graduate because their daddy bought them the degree. Go to the University of Waterloo if you want to be someone's boss, not a U of T clerk. Even the Warriors football team is better than [U of T's].
		Example: "I got into the [U of T] but was not accepted into the University of [Waterloo]."
		
		U of T student to [U of W] student: "Transcendentals? I made out with one accidentally at the bar once, I was wasted."

	(2005-08-22 +284/-553)
	A great University if ur in Engineering, Accounting, Math, and Science(Optometry) other then that if ur there ur wasting ur time because it isn't as easy as [Ryerson] or Xavier etc. and it ranks as one of the toughest universities as it has some of the smartest people in Canada the Engineering and Accounting Faculty's [Avg]. student has above 90% [AVG], most of the people hate it cuz they go there and expect to [slack off] and receive good marks, but it doesn't work that way, Work hard and get ur reward.
		Example: 1. Me: I am going to [UW]
		2. [Stranger]: You mean University of Waterloo? its one of the best in [Canada man], Good luck!

	(2009-04-25 +152/-391)
	A university situated in Southern Ontario, it is acclaimed for its prestigious Engineering and Math programs.  
	
	It is also notorious in the poker world as a "Poker Factory", producing many of the top players in the [WSOp], like [Nenad] Medic, [Michael McDonald], Steve Black, Will Ma etc.
		Example: I hear your going to the University of Waterloo for [Engineering]! If that doesnt work out you can just pick up [poker], there is something [in the water] there.

	(2005-01-08 +188/-525)
	If you ain't here for [Engineering], Math, or [accounting], you're [wasting your money].
		Example: I go to Uwaterloo for Planning....

		I go to Uwaterloo for [civil engineering]....
		I go to Uwaterloo for [environmental] engineering....
		I go to Uwaterloo for Math & Business (not double degree)
		I go to Uwaterloo for arts. 
		I go to Uwaterloo for applied health studies. 
		
		You are [wasting your money].

	(2013-10-17 +60/-168)
	If you ain't in University of Waterloo ([UW]) for engineering or some other nerdy stuff like that, you're misusing your money and time, but not necessarily wasting it. UW will also bore you to death. It's a pit where only nerds thrive. That is the price UW is paying to making it to the top in such a [short time] (less than 60 years).
	
	The [accolades] in ranking for UW speak for themselves:
	
	-> 2012 Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU) ranking: UW ranked 2nd in Canada and 43rd in the world (for the field of engineering, technology and computer sciences)
	
	-> 2012 Business [Insider] rankings: UW ranked 1st in Canada and 29th in the world (in the list of top engineering schools)

	-> 2013 [QS] World University rankings: UW ranked 2nd in Canada and 46th in the world (for the field of engineering)
	
	-> 2013 QS World University rankings: UW ranked 2nd in Canada and [27th] in the world (in the specific field of computer science and [information systems])

University of Western Ontario
	(2009-04-09 +791/-373)
	[Slang] for an [STD]
		Example: I've been all over [the University] of [Western] [Ontario] and now it hurts to pee.

	(2010-11-17 +390/-240)
	where stupid white sluts go because they don't want to go to [U of T] because its "[too hard]" or because they couldn't get into [McGill].
		Example: [wise guy] 1: "Dude do you know why the University of Western Ontario doesn't celebrate Christmas?"
		wise guy 2: "Why?"
		wise guy 1: "[Because they can't] find a virgin or [three wise men]. hahahha lolz"

	(2010-08-29 +560/-352)
	The University of Western [Ontario] ([UWO]) prides itself upon being the number one choice for underachieving white trash who have [delusions of grandeur].
	
	Although the anti-intellectual environment of UWO is readily apparent when engaging in conversation with a UWO student, Western students attempt to highlight their ignorance by continuously dying their hair blonde, in case
	you were somehow oblivious to the fact that you were conversing with a retard. The blonde hair serves as a telling reminder.
		Example: Blonde [UWO] girl: I go to the [Ivey] school of business, so I'll be an Ivey League graduate.
		Non-UWO guy: I think you mean Ivy League. The Ivy League consists of eight private [American schools]. The University of Western Ontario is not a member.
		
		Blonde UWO girl: What? Whatever, I'm cute. Let's have sex.

	(2014-02-16 +37/-37)
	[THE WHITE WASHED] PARTY SCHOOL of Canada. White students or white washed students go here bacause they eather didn't get into [U of T] or they thought U of T was was too hard. They also couldn't get into Queens they think too highly of themselves to go to any other university (like [Lakehead]). UWO is a wanna-be "Ivy League" school. This preppy school is home to some of the best looking over achieveing students in this polar country! Its one of the oldest and most beautiful universityes ever attracting U of T rejects since 1878.
		Example: [Prep boy] 1: Damm, i never got into to [U of T]. Well, i didn't wanna turn into a mindless robot anyways.
		
		Prep boy 2: oh so what are u goin to do now?
		
		Prep boy 1: Well, guess ill accept my offer to the University of Western Ontario.
		Prep boy 2: Good idea, you can't go wrong with that!
		
		Prep boy 1: Thats right, I won't become a brain washed zombie and ill be hanging out with the [hottest people] Ever!

	(2007-04-03 +689/-565)
	A university located in London, Ontario, Canada which maintains to have one of the highest entering averages of all schools in Canada and possibly the United States with most programs now requiring at least a 90% average out of high school. Despite its high stress on academics and many awarded professors, it is known to be the party school of Canada, be home to one of [David Letterman's] [top ten] places to get knocked up, saugeen- [maitland] hall residence, and hold the most good looking students of all Canadian universities. With its award winning campus and ivy covered [limestone] walls it resembles an ivy league university complete with the reputation. Nicknamed the country club, its built on the site of a former golf and country club and retains this name due to its attracting of some of the richest students in Canada and internationally. Lacoste, Abercrombie, Polo, Lululemon, Hollister, Gucci, Ugg, are just some of the identifying signs of a student that attends [UWO], also a sense of oblivion as to anything going on outside of the "Western bubble" and its gates is quite prevalent amongst its students. It could be confused for an [American school] with its abundance of Fraternities and Sororities. It is home to many sports teams (including a rowing team which beat out all ivy league schools and many other international schools), [tennis courts] complete with covered [domes] in the winter, the popular student hangout The Spoke, a restaurant/bar/club The Wave, and even a [fine dining] restaurant Michaels, the [Ivey] school of business, and a soon to be built recreation centre that will rival those of many of the biggest athletic schools in the US (even though it will most likely not better the football teams success). UWO - you love it (the parents that believe their children are truly earning the family company they are the heir to) or hate it (every other Canadian university).
		Example: [University of Western Ontario] is the most [americanized] school outside of [the USA].

	(2007-03-27 +494/-438)
	A university located in London, Ontario, Canada. The University of Western Ontario, commonly known as either Western or [UWO], was founded in 1878 and is thus one of the oldest universities in Canada.
	
	[Western's] student body is famous in Canada for being made up of a bunch of spoiled rich kids who have particularly poor academic abilities, though the university seems to labour under the delusion that it is somehow "Ivy League".
	
	The typical Western student is a [fabulously] [dumb blond] boy or girl who says 'like' at least three times per sentence, and hangs out at one of the lame-ass bars on Richmond Street (especially The Ceeps or Jim Bob [Ray's]) every night getting wasted and breaking into fistfights over scarce [cabs] once the bars close. They also refuse to wear coats even when the weather is minus 40 degrees, because a coat would cover up their stuffed booby cleavage or obscure their tiny little gym pecs.
		Example: Jenn: I couldn't, like, get into the University of Toronto, so, like,  I guess I'll go to Western. Yaaaaay!!!!
		
		Bryce the [frat boy]: Hey bro, I go to The [University of Western Ontario] because it's the only school in Canada where the girls are dumb enough to [have sex with me].

University of Windsor
	(2009-05-08 +104/-51)
	Located in [Windsor, Ontario], Canada the University of Windsor is the southernmost university in all of Canada. (however, like pretty much all Canadian universities it still gets it's share of snow during the winter.)
	
	The [U of W] is known for having one of the more internationally diverse student bodies in all of Canada, but the majority of it's students are still from the Windsor-Essex County and Chatam area (over 80% of students who go on to university from these areas will attend the U of W).
	
	Historically, it hasn't scored well in [Maclean's] [Magazine's] annual University Rankings, but then again Maclean's Magazine is basically the Fox News of the North. In reality, the university offers a wide range of undergraduate and graduate degrees, including a well renown engineering program which has placed in the top 3 in each of the past three years in a competition against other engineering programs in Ontario.
	
	Richard [Peddie] president and CEO of Maple Leafs sports and entertainment, graduated from the U of W with a degree in business and is still a proud supporter of the school and has be known to offer internships to Windsor MBA students.
	
	Finally some of the benefits U of W students enjoy are a lively downtown district located close to the campus (5 minute [bus ride]), 3 pro sports teams located in downtown Detroit (Red Wings, Tigers and Lions) and the [newly renovated] and state of the art St. Dennis Center facility which played host to the 2008 Canadian Olympic Trials and is home to [Lancer's] Football, Basketball, Soccer, Volleyball and the CIS champion track and Field team.
		Example: Person1: So I heard you were thinking about the University of [Windsor]
		Person2: Yeah, I am. But what about their rating in [Maclean's]?
		Person1: Dude, it's Maclean's!
		Person2: [Good point]...

	(2009-01-26 +64/-48)
	A university where all kids drive Chrysler Cavalier F150 and [sunfire's].
	
	Where weed flows like water in river, and the desi jams have nothing but men and bad BO.
	
	Everyone [has pizza] plus on speed dial, where drug dealers have email for faster delivery.
	
	The [leddy] library is a social club where people go to study but end up re-grouping for weed session and some more ps3.
	
	More time is spent on weed and ps3, then talking to family, friends, class, and more many mandatory important life items.
	
	The business and Law programs are exceptionally well and compete with [Ivey] League schools.
		Example: [Sartaj]: Dude, Lets play FIFA and leave the University of Windsor
		[Vaibhav]: dude, after one more joint..
		[Tushar]: Someone roll, please....im sobering up...
		Vaibhav: shit, no more blunt wraps

	(2008-04-09 +101/-105)
	A deliberately mismanaged university that consists of a cesspool of students who realize they made a mistake by coming here.
	-Will accept anyone: 
	* who can spell their name in English. 
	* knows what day it is.
	AKA a money university, [last chance] university.
	
	Transfer students usually end up here for [a good education] and realize later they've made [a big mistake].
	
	Watch roger and me to get an idea of what Windsor is like.(currently suffering the same fate as most industrial cities like detroit)
	
		Example: person1:where do you [study] again?
		person2:[university of windsor]
		person1:[right]..

	(2011-05-29 +28/-79)
	One of the worst universities in Canada, as it fails to make it on the top 100 list of Canadian Universities. Those who are dumb enough to get enrolled there and accept usually drop out and/or do nothing successful with their lives. Most of those who attend the University of [Windsor] are scared to move away from home and leave their parents, and/or are of the less fortunate as they cannot afford to [study abroad]. Those who attend the University of Windsor think they are the shit, but really will not get anywhere in life as the evil spirits of [Windsor, Ontario] have unfortunately sucked them in for the rest of eternity.
		Example: A professor from [the University] of [Windsor] came to my international [boarding school] to give a speech today and not one person showed up!
		
		or
		
		I heard the University of Windsor is the worst university in Canada!
		
		or
		
		Dude you go to the Univeristy of Windsor? How basic, you should transfer.

University of Wisconsin Madison
	(2005-09-26 +653/-333)
	Unlike the above definition, the University of Wisconsin Madison is a prestigious university where education is everything but so is having a good time.  You will find the most school spirit in Madison than anywhere else in Wisconsin.  We are the number one party school but do not "fuck around" or "[fuck-off]".  [Time management] is a [must-have] skill here (obviously if we go out everynight but still get up and get an A on an exam the next morning).  
		Example: Wow, I can't believe [_____] got into the University of Wisconsin [Madison], he/she must have a really good GPA.
		
		It's such a prestigious school to go to.
		
		I can't believe you can go out almost everynight and still get a [4.0].

It is generally known for its excellent Engineering and Business Programs, both of which are rated highly by both [the Princeton Review] and US News. [UW-Madison] also has excellent science programs, including Physics, Chemistry, and Biology. It is the flagship school of the UW system, as it usually refers to itself as "Wisconsin" (see [wisc].edu, or the newly named "Wisconsin School of Business) and generally bashed by those who cannot get in. With its student population of roughly 41,000, it is one of the largest public universities in the US. The campus is located in downtown Madison, bordering Lake [Mendota]. Home to such progressives as Robert La Follette, and also due to its vast number of protests in the Vietnam War era, the city, including the university, has gained a reputation as being a [hotbed] of liberalism, which makes it a very awesome place. All in all, its a "public ivy", and thus you have to work very hard, but actually get a degree thats worth something. Also, there is a bit of partying between the constant barrage of papers and tests, thus giving Madison its legendary status.
		Example: Person A: "The University of Wisconsin Madison is a really shitty school"
		Person B: "You're just saying that because you couldn't get into Madison."
		Person A: "No i'm not"
		(Day before)
		Person A: "Oh, I got a [rejection letter] from Madison. Well, it looks like i'm going to [Parkside]."

University of Wisconsin
	(2009-03-29 +283/-71)
	The University of Wisconsin is a large public university in [the Wisconsin] capital of Madison. It is one of the largest campuses in the USA, and is one of the best colleges in the world. It is one of the Public [Ivies], that is, a public university that offers an education equivalent to those of the private Ivy League schools. It is consistently ranked in the top 35 among all US schools, and in the top 10 among all public schools. The majority of their undergraduate majors are ranked within the top 10 nationally, and the university is one of the top 20 research institutions in the world. The University of Wisconsin, also known as [UW], is tied with Harvard for producing the highest number of [CEO's], and has produced some of the largest amounts of doctors, lawyers, engineers, businessmen, and millionaires. What is unique about UW is that not only is it one of the top academic institutions in the world, but it is also one of the biggest party schools and is known for being one of the best campuses in America. Playboy magazine named UW the biggest party school in America, and ESPN named Madison the best college sports town. UW is associated with two gigantic drinking fests: [Halloween's] [Freakfest] and [Mifflin] [Block Party]. Both are two of the largest college drinking fests in the country, attracting thousands upon thousands of drunk students.
		Example: Joe: "I go to the University of Wisconsin in [Madison]."

		Example: Mike: After [hitting up] University of Wisconsin [Milwaukee] want to go to Oakland [Gyro's]?

	A lesser known campus in the [UW] public school system, the University of Wisconsin [Parkside] was founded back in 1968. It's one of the newest UW schools, and because of that it is greatly under appreciated by the majority of the state. Unlike schools such as [UW-Madison] or UW-Milwaukee, UW-Parkside hasn't had a chance to establish it's reputation as a quality and worth-while school to attend, so many people use it as a fall back option. However, Parkside is a fantastic school with a diverse campus.
		Example: [Greg's] parent's weren't [thrilled] when the only school he was accepted to was University of Wisconsin Parkside, but [four years] and a bachelors degree later, they realized he had been in good hands.

All in all, its a "public ivy", and thus you have to work very hard, but actually get a degree thats worth something. Also, there is a bit of partying between the constant barrage of papers and tests, thus giving Madison its legendary status.
		Example: Person A: "The University of Wisconsin Madison is a really shitty school"
		Person B: "You're just saying that because you couldn't get into Madison."
		Person A: "No i'm not"
		(Day before)
		Person A: "Oh, I got a [rejection letter] from Madison. Well, it looks like i'm going to [Parkside]."
		
		(New Student at Madison)
		New Student: "What the f**k is that thing?"
		Not Noob: "That is [Mosse] Humanities. The most polarizing building on campus."
		New Student: "Doesn't it look like a futuristic fortress from a 1960's film?"
		Not Noob: "Yes, yes it does."
		
		"Yay, I got a Business or Engineering degree from UW. I'm going to be very rich/powerful very soon. Bow."

	2.Lack of any activities after 7pm that dont involve getting hammered
	3.Coldest enviroment of any 4 [year school] in the United States
	
	4. Over 24 bars plus another 10 places to buy alcohol for a place with a population of around 25000
	5. Depression that sets in once you realize you have decended into the 5th circle of hell AKA [laradise]
		Example: Student 1:Hey guys we've been drinking for 5 days straight lets [change it up] I know the University of Wyoming doesnt have anything going on but theres got to be something else to do
		Student 2: We could always go outside and freeze to death
		Student 3: We could sit around and have a circle jerk
		Student 1: Fine lets just go to the [Buckhorn Bar]
		
		Student 3: No im too classy for that lets hit the Cowboy bar but the one on 3rd st not the cowboy [bar on] 2nd St
		Student 2: I've been drunk since 5pm so i dont really care

	(2011-11-27 +64/-58)
	The BEST of the west. School made up of the best people on earth...the kids from real colorado come here AKA people without money coming out of their ears. Badass mascot COWBOYS!! Only school in the state so we got wyoming pride even the out of staters. If your from wyoming you can come here for basicly free and if your out of state its most likley cheaper than an [in state] school. You can do whatever your want party, hiking, shooting, hit up the [buckhorn] or the cowboy. Great academics and overall just awsome school.
	POWDER RIVER....[LET 'ER BUCK] we all got poke pride!!
		Example: [trust fund baby]: Im going to CU or CSU i really like the enviroment of the campus and the weed.
		UW cowboy: I would only go down there to beat the shit out of some faggots.
		trust fund baby: thats such a typical [university of wyoming] comment , as he turns on his BMW.
		UW cowboy: your god damn right cause i ride [for the brand]! as he gets into his chevy.

	(2009-01-19 +54/-85)
	Boring little school that is the [poster child] of 'the [middle of nowhere].' The only four year place of [higher education] (if you want to call it education) in the state. Pros: has a beautiful view, is the state with the second most beautiful girls in the country, has a long term parking lot, there's a Wal-Mart. Cons: Cowboys, Cowboy attitude, lack of culture/class, lack of parking space, there's a Wal-Mart.
		Example: Me: "I hate [this town], with a passion." 
		
		If you don't have the 'Cowboy attitude' at the University of [Wyoming], you are generally ignored. If you have any sort of taste/class/culture you may be subject to [threats] of physical violence.

	(2011-05-03 +44/-90)
	Basically the place where no one wants to have to go school. The only way the school gets students is because it has some of the lowest tuition rates for a division I school in the nation, and if you [sign your name] on the bottom of the ACT you can be admitted. Located in [Laramie], a shitty place even by wyoming standards. The wind never stops blowing across the desolate plains, and snow is fact of life for 7 months of the year. This place redefines lame. The student body is made up of hicks and cowboys from everywhere, most all of [Wyoming's] high school graduates, poor kids from the Colorado front range, and all other of the absolute weirdest [low lifes] imaginable. The athletic programs at the Univerisity of have a dismal record. [Most good] athletes leave after a year or two for better places. The only thing to do in Laramie is to get shit faced drunk or wish you are. Men here at the university have [no shot] at hot women because the 15 or so who attend the college come from rural areas. They have never seen a black man before, so the few dark skinned football and basketball players have a monopoly on them. The university of wyoming is a hopeless institution.
		Example: Dude your gonna go to the University of [Wyoming]?! Wow. you must have not had good enough grades for the local [community college]. Its way better of a place than U of [Wyo].

	(2007-11-30 +30/-60)
	random little school that actually exists
	
	no [pretention]
	
	the only [four] year college in [Wyoming]. seriously.
		Example: [university] of where?
		
		university of wyoming....they have a school there?
		
		As they said in [Philly], "Oh- you're moving to the [west coast]?"

		Example: [Bob's] a true [Unix] genius, [just look] at the size of his Unix beard!

	(2013-08-27 +12/-46)
	It is the excuse hipster junior System Administrators use when they leave long beards. It is supposed to be measuring the level of expertise however it is really a [ruse] , a [masquerade] for them to satisfy their deeper hipster motivations. You can easily spot them when they compare their beard not with Tovald's but with the one [Clooney] has.
		Example: [Dimitris] clames he keeps his beard long to mark his UNIX expertise, calling it a UNIX beard. Hack through his [browser history] though, you'll see lots of [Clooney] images.

unix
	(2004-06-22 +361/-49)
	UNIX rose from the ashes of a multi-organizational effort in the early 1960s to develop a dependable timesharing operating system.  After three decades of use, the UNIX* computer operating system is still regarded as one of the most powerful, versatile, and flexible operating system in the computer world. Its popularity is due to many factors, including its ability to run a wide variety of machines, from [micros] to supercomputers, and its [portability], all of which led to its adoption by many manufacturers.  The system also fostered a distinctive approach to [software design], solving a problem by interconnecting simpler tools, rather than creating large [monolithic] application programs.  Its development and evolution led to a new philosophy of computing, and it has been a never-ending source of both challenges and joy to programmers around the world.
		Example: "[UNIX] is basically a simple [operating system], but you have to be a genius to understand the simplicity." - Dennis [Ritchie]

	(2005-04-04 +55/-46)
	[FreeBSD],[NetBSD],BSDi are more popular [unix] systems among others.  They are more usefull on the server scene, for they have almost total control, and modification applications.  One could change anything to everything on a unix system provided they have the know how.
	
	One should take note that Apple [Os X] is based on [Unix](Darwin).  
	
	Linux and Unix differ on many points, and are greatly argued upon which one is better.  It seems one should use both and see which one he/she likes.
		Example: [I see that] you are using [Unix]! My what a great [system] you have.

	(2004-06-13 +91/-96)
	The [plural] [form] of [eunuch].
		Example: A [Dilbert] comic strip...

		The Boss: "If the company nurse drops by, tell her I said 'never mind.'"

	* Wear t-shirts 2 sizes too small that fails to conceal a hairy beer belly underneath
	* Have a number of keys dangling from a [keyring]
	* Are [socially challenged]
	* Will quote lines from episodes of Star Trek 
	* Enjoy heavy rock / metal music. Note: occassionally an older unix [techhead] will admit to a liking of folk music - these individuals are very dangerous and should be avoided... Worse still is the Unix nerd who enjoys prog rock - anyone with an early Genesis album in their music collection should be treated with suspicion
		Example: Hi Jane, I really like you and was wondering if I could take you out to a Unix seminar next week ?
		
		I've re-written the Shell on this Unix server configuration and we're now running a [warp factor] 8
		
		I spent many a happy hour playing with [Unix's] Vi editor as I listenned to [Fairport] Convention in the backgound

unjoke
	(2008-06-13 +54/-4)

	Usually told to make the joke teller laugh at [the audience's] dissapointment and confusion. Most of the time, some of the audience members join in [the laugher] as an attempt not to look like "the guy who didn't get the joke".
		Example: The most common Unjokes are: The Tennis Ball Joke, The [Friar] Joke, The Clown Joke, [The Shaggy Dog] Joke
		
		I dont feel like typing out one of the incredibly long jokes... so here is a short one.

Unlock Reality
	(2006-09-19 +554/-69)
	A term used when someone says something deep or wise. Derived from [the underground] text called Unlock Reality, which claims to explain the Construction of the Universe in terms that anyone can understand, and is being shared [round the world] using [bookcrossing].
		Example: Someone says "[we need] [more love] in this world" 
		the [reply] is, "hey you Unlock Reality man.

	(2006-09-18 +36/-8)
	A [manuscript] which explains the Construction of the Universe in simple terms that anyone can understand. Some [claim it] is an [urban myth] while others claim to have read it.
		Example: There follow some points about it:
		
		Point One:
		Unlock Reality is a book in manuscript form that is just over 100 pages long.
		
		Point Two:
		It does not have an author listed though it is widely rumoured that five main people are involved with its production. Two are reported to be Monks of some sort, one a Metaphysics Professor working in a British University and two other gifted people with no specific qualifications.
		
		Point Three:
		Unlock Reality has been briefly descried as “one of the most unusual publications on the planet, with the potential to produce a shift in perception that could change the course of history and guarantee the survival of the human race
		
		Point Four:
		It is being prepared for world release by a group called I.S.D.T. and there is also a group trying to prevent it getting out who go by the name of The Brotherhood of the [Eternal Light].
		
		[Point Five]:
		Those preparing it for world release have been affected strangely and been inspired to follow childhood dreams. This is sometimes referred to as the UR effect.  These include going to the [Himalayas], taking up skydiving, starting websites of which there are hundreds and writung poetry.
		
		[Point Six]:
		All those concerned with proof reading and the production have had to sign confidentiality contracts. In addition all copies request that readers do not quote or copy from it so no quotes have appeared anywhere.
		
		Point Seven:
		50 copies were released via [Bookcrossing].
		 
		Point Eight:
		Many people are involved in an international [treasure hunt] for the 50 copies.
		 
		[Point Nine]:
		There is a project to place copies permanently in key locations around the world, including the Grand Canyon, and [Tower Bridge]. There is meant to be a copy being held by Tibetan Monks for safekeeping and the [Dalai Lama] was recently presented with a copy as was the Archbishop of Canterbury.
		
		Point Ten:
		There is quite a storm over whether or not Unlock Reality is real or not; ironic for something that has sparked much debate over the nature of reality.

	A method to pass the lock screen and get into the operating system to use it. Users are required to slide their finger on a predefined position [on the lock] screen. Popularised by Apple's iPhone, and Apple has patented the whole vague idea, thus making it one of the most ridiculous patents yet.
	
	There hardly could be a method to unlock the screen by doing a certain action on the screeen itself without violating that [patent]. For example, Apple also claimed that a tap on the screen is a 'zero-length sliding'. Microsoft introduced a picture password unlock screen to [Windows 8], but that is also essentially a [slide to unlock].
	
	Google has improved and diversified the slide to unlock on Android in many ways, so that now they look so very different. Yet, Apple wants to ban Android products for this patent or wants the manufacturers to pay a ridiculously high patent fee for this.
		Example: A Japanese man: You know, we used [to slide] the door to open it and get into the room.
		
		An Apple guy: Hey, that sounds like [slide to unlock] to me. You violated our [patent]! You'd better stop using that door.

		Example: There follow some points about it:
		
		Point One:
		Unlock Reality is a book in manuscript form that is just over 100 pages long.
		
		Point Two:
		It does not have an author listed though it is widely rumoured that five main people are involved with its production. Two are reported to be Monks of some sort, one a Metaphysics Professor working in a British University and two other gifted people with no specific qualifications.
		
		Point Three:
		Unlock Reality has been briefly descried as “one of the most unusual publications on the planet, with the potential to produce a shift in perception that could change the course of history and guarantee the survival of the human race
		
		Point Four:
		It is being prepared for world release by a group called I.S.D.T. and there is also a group trying to prevent it getting out who go by the name of The Brotherhood of the [Eternal Light].
		
		[Point Five]:
		Those preparing it for world release have been affected strangely and been inspired to follow childhood dreams. This is sometimes referred to as the UR effect.  These include going to the [Himalayas], taking up skydiving, starting websites of which there are hundreds and writung poetry.
		
		[Point Six]:

Unofficial
	(2013-02-10 +313/-67)
	Short for Unofficial St. Patrick's Day, this is an event held each March at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. This is the largest local drinking holiday in the United States. It was created due to St. Patrick's Day being held over [U of I's] spring break. Students from across the country visit [Champaign-Urbana] to take part in this, as their schools do not consume as much in an entire decade as [U of I] does on Unofficial.
		Example: "Dude, don't you love going to [IU]?" - Indiana Student 1
		
		"No, I am going to [U of I] this weekend to celebrate Unofficial. I wish I had gotten good enough grades to [get in there]." - Indiana Student 2
		
		"Yeah, you're right. They are better at academics, athletics, AND they have way more fun." - Indiana Student 1

	(2006-03-31 +644/-199)
	Unofficial as in Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. It is the main drinking event on the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign during the year. It usually occurs a few weeks before actual St. Patrick's Day. Students wake up on Friday and begin the festivities around 8AM, while some begin as early as 6. People walk around with beer in their hands, [Nalgene] bottles filled with a cornucopia of alcoholic beverages. The bars open at 11AM, though they used to open at 8, and [green beer] is EVERYWHERE. People go to class and take quizzes wasted, [campus police] guard the large lecture halls, city police guard the residence halls, and best of all, the drinking goes on ALL DAY LONG. God bless America.
		Example: Dude 1-"Dude, it's 9am on Unofficial and I'm not wasted yet."
		Dude 2-"[That blows], here, I filled my [Nalgene] with vodka, [drink up]."

	(2009-01-28 +164/-381)
	A one, and recently two-day celebration created by Champaign-IL bar owners when they realized they were missing out on [St. Patrick's] Day-related money from students at the University of Illinois. Every year, these owners buy the services of several advertising companies to start [Facebook groups] that pose as student-created, touting how they will break the rules and [flout] convention by drinking alcohol all day on Unofficial St. Patrick's Day. Gullible students are all too happy to oblige, believing they are doing something rebellious. Bar drink prices are jacked up, many citations and arrests are made, and sometimes a person or two dies.
	
	It is also the source of much argument between squabbling Midwest schools, as to who has the more "out of control" party.
		Example: Dude, can you believe [Murphy's] is charging 20 dollar cover? Or that those green beers are [5 bucks] a piece? It must be Unofficial [St. Patrick's Day]!

	(2009-02-24 +97/-641)
	A throughly racist [drinking holiday] celebrated at the University of Illinois sometime in the weeks preceeding [St. Patrick's] to make up for students being on spring break over the holiday. It is charecterized by [its green], "Irish" theme, and strong reinforcement of often negative Irish and Irish-American stereotypes. It has nothing whatsover to do with authentic Irish culture or St. Patrick's Day at all. 
		Example: Student #1: Hey, it's Unofficial, wanna [get pissed]?
		Student #2: No, but [thank you so much] for desecrating my [heritage]. 

	(2006-09-10 +1188/-331)
	Unofficial is the phrase commonly used to describe the Friday prior to [St. Patrick's day] at The University of Illinois.  The holiday began when students realized [St. Patrick's Day] was falling on spring break and they would not be able to celebrate it.  The day is marked by bars opening at 8 in the morning, kegs [on front] lawns, students from nearly all surrounding schools flooding the campus to celebrate by drinking obscene amounts of alcohol.  It has been said that more drinking occurs on Unofficial at [U of I] than occurs at many other school's entire years.
		Example: Oh man, I got so [bellig] on [Unofficial] [last year].

	(2008-02-27 +130/-645)
	"Unofficial Day" is a lame asinine day, now two days, created by local bar owners to cleverly exploit dollars from immature risk-taking students. It's simply plan to minimize the dollars lost during the absence of students on St. Patrick's Day, which occurs while students are on the [Uni's] Spring Break. The idiotic [event's] only claim to infamy is [marathon drinking] while wearing [green shirts].  There is [no entertainment]; there are no festivals, no organized music concerts, NOTHING, except the attempts to make money by promoting the consumption of intolerable and unsafe amounts of alcohol by college students, many of them being underage. The promoters of this even make no efforts whatsoever to ensure, even the minimal safety of any participant. The 2007 event resulted in the death of a female. The students don't know any better, because they are young and impressionable, and see it as just another party without consequence. It is just a PITIFUL excuse by some local bar owners to exploit the ignorance of youth, and simply make money without any regard for the health, safety or laws of Champaign, Urbana or the Great State of Illinois.

	(2004-11-14 +250/-76)
	Unreal Tournament is a fast paced first person shooter style game.
	
	The series is now on its 3rd game, unreal tournament 2004 (last was ut2003, and before that the original UT) and soon to release UT2005 (Think sports games). [UT2004] features fast-paced, solo and team oriented gameplay, as well as good implementation of vehicles.
	
	The game has almost no single player gameline, and focuses on battlefield style gameplay with implementaion of bots. There are many different gamemodes; including deathmatch, team deathmatch, [bombing run], capture the flag, last man standing, mutant, [double domination], onslaught and assualt. 
	
	Onslaught and assualt both feature vehicluar warfare, and introduce single crew and multi crew vehicles; including the scorpion, [manta], raptor, goliath, [hellbender], and [levithian]. 
	
	Unreal tournament is designed with a much faster, explosive gameplay than titles like counterstrike and battlefield 1942. Most maps are medium sized and will leave you to encounter enemies every 2-10 seconds or so, and with constant [respawning], (not round based) this means that it takes [fast reflexes] and sharp wit.
	
	The gameplay also features various acrobatic stunts, such as the ability to dodge (double tap a dirction key), wall jump (dodge after jumping near a wall, thereby pushing your characetr off the wall in a flip or cartwheel) and dodge jumping (dodge, then jump to send your character launching through the air at a significant rate)
	
	There are also various power ups, such as double damage, shields, health pickups, health viles, kegs of health and adrenaline. The adrenaline powerups increase you adrenaline level to a max of 100, at which point you can activate one of four combos (speed, beserk, invisible, and booster)
	
	The above are based on UT2004, which obviously offers more features than UT2003 and UT Classic, however these prequels can be understood by thier loyal sequal, [ut2004].
	
	Overall, UT contains [enoguh] features to create dynamic, diverse, and broad gameplay, complete with tons of maps (UT2004 comes with well over 100).
		Example: Unreal Tournament is a much faster-paced, [explosive] shooting game than [counterstrike], but offers [jsut] as much fun and possibly much more variety.

	Its contradictory in that you feel incredible because you love someone so much, but also at the same time you feel almost overwhelming despair because you will never know what it is like to hold them in your arms, or touch their face, or kiss their lips. You will never know what it is like to [wake-up] next to them in bed in the morning, bodies entwined.
	
	It can be masochistic in nature- it causes such [heartache], but you enjoy loving the person so much, you willingly let your heart go through the agony, so you can hold onto something- I don't know, maybe hope?

	[Loving someone] in ways that are unexplainable. Although, your "spouse," or "love interest," makes you feel they are incapable of providing such love in return. It's waking up with them on your mind, sending text messages that seem like it takes an eternity to get a response to. Its [loving someone] so much, you allow them to hurt you, in hopes that they'll realize how much you care. It's having someone consistently tell you I'm not in love with you, but I have love for you, after a moment that to you felt so [surreal]. Its having hopes of a [fairy tale] with this person you love, yet having them feel as though they could never play that role in your cast... Its doing all you can to prove your love only to feel like it's still not enough and its still [unappreciated]. It hurts at times when you think about what's missing. But in those moments when you two are laughing or sharing a sweet moment, those times you hear them call you "babe," and "bae," you feel a connection and an undeniable emotion for this person, you feel a joy and excitement to have such a connection, and then you remember this person refuses to claim you or your heart.

	A love that is one-sided, [malnourished], and weak.
	It is felt only by one person for another that does not return the same feeling.
	It is desperate, frustrating, and out-of-control. I am personally experiencing it now with a boy I am so deeply in love with. We are together, and his love for me was warm and all-encompassing a couple of months ago. Recently he revealed to me that he does not love me anymore. It feels as though I am suffering as much as if he passed. The grief is immense. He has told me that he still wants me around as his best friend. There is no light in his eyes when he says this. He is distant, [detached], gone. I am neglected by his presence and his [lost feelings] for me. I feel absolutely lonely.
	Now, I must [do one] of the hardest things of my life and tell the boy I love, the one I thought I would get married to and love endlessly, that my love has to end for my own sanity. I have to tell him there is no place for him in my life. A life I had always [pictured] with him in it. I must tell the one I love that I cannot live like this anymore.
		Example: "How can someone [fall out] of love with me and still want to be together?"
		"That sounds like a unique case of [unrequited love]."
		"I just cannot believe I still am [so in love] with him. I'd rather be in love with a stranger than in love like this."

	(2016-04-24 +28/-3)

Also they would learn about [biomes] by learning about how different monsters live and do better (in both the game and show) in different environments and then discussing with them how that relates to animals in real life. History would come from learning about the Japanese culture and the history of television, card games and their impact on society, Language arts could come from writing to a Japanese [pen pal] about anime they have their and the societal differences such as America's censorship of material allowed in Japan.

You can talk to people, form hunting parties, even guilds and communities. Unfortunately, the game has been a bit nerfed for years, and ever since Age of Shadows, an [expansion pack], the game isn't what it used to be.

Say it with a little confidence and a smile, but don't be aggressive - that's not the right way to go about things in the broad brown [land of oz].

Upper Arlington
	(2006-11-08 +273/-97)
	Suburb of northwest [Columbus, Ohio]. Originally founded as a commercial real estate enterprise. The city of Upper Arlington has distinguished itself with it's ability [to house] conservative, successful, and wealthy families in the face of overwhelming foreign immigration to the region. Boasting effective leadership, the city has maintained a barrier between successful and non-successful people since [1918].

	(2008-04-18 +239/-120)
	Located near downtown Columbus, Ohio, it is a small suburban city filled mostly with middle-upper class white families. It has one high school, naturally named [Upper Arlington High School]. The city draws much jealousy from the surrounding suburbs such as HIlliard, Dublin, Worthington, etc. because of the economic success of the families residing in UA. ANother thing that draws jealousy from the other suburbs is that [Upper ARlington High School] consistently and continually rapes other high schools at sports such as Lacrosse, Football, Swimming, Water Polo, Hockey etc. It's 100+ Div. 1 state championships are a record in Ohio high schools, and therefore cats from across the [scioto] and olentangy rivers whine and try to insult UA.
	Also has the lowest percentage of anorexic girls in central Ohio
		Example: [worthington] guy: [hey sweetie], let's go to Upper Arlington and make fun of the architectural quality of their houses cuz our football team hasn't beat them in 39 years.
		Dublin guy: thats a good idea hunny, I wanna get back at them for continually raping us up the butt in lacrosse
		[Hilliard] guy: speaking of "up the butt" you guys wanna get some at my house later tonight.

	(2011-03-09 +85/-121)
	Upper Arlington is a suburban community located in Northwest Central Ohio. [UA] is community dominated by upper class, preppy, arrogant, white people. (but not as preppy as Dublin.) There is one high school in UA, and it's appropiately named [Upper Arlington High School]. They are quite proud of there 100+ state championships, but a person who doesn't have their head up their ass will tell you that more than half of the championships are in tennis and the only reason UA has displayed such dominance in tennis is because all kids there have practically been raised on country clubs. Their success in golf can also be accredited to this.
	The kids who go to UAHS are notorious for being arrogant [meat heads] who have nothing else better to do than hit the weight room and check scorecenter on the 64G iTouches. It is also well known that if in any competitve activity a UA kid will threaten to hurt you, but outside of it they will merely whimper and go sit over by their parents.
	
	For what UA lacks in minorites, middle class families, and modest athletes, they sure do make up for in in Lax Bros. Most are pot heads but since their parents are all lawyers or judges they get around these situations farily easily.
	Alll in all, UA is not a community for someone who wants to live a real life with people of differnt race, social class, etc. If you want to live in a town where [high school sports] arent everyones biggets prioity, live in [Worthington].
		Example: [UA] kid: "hey we beat you guys in football this year."
		[Worthington] kid: "where you goin to school man?"
		UA kid: "C-state."
		Worthington kid: "Oh I'm goin to Illinois on an academic scholarship. Strange how the world works huh?'
		
		Worthington kid: " do you know that black kid over there named [Jalen]?"
		UA kid: "whats a black kid?"
		Worthington kid: "oh Upper Arlington..."

		Example: [dublin] guy: you're so beautiful
		
		upper arlington girl: [aww thanks]
		
		upper arlington guy: you're hot
		
		upper arlington girl: [i love you].

	(2006-12-02 +112/-245)

	An all-boys prep school located in Toronto, and widely considered the leading independent school in Canada - it is even said to rival top American prep schools like [GDA], Exeter, and Andover. 
	
	While UCC is considered a great academic school, it is also known for its athletics. Hockey is by far the most prominent sport, getting all the athletics money, while other teams, who are equally successful, seem to be neglected. Hockey players, who are entirely scholarship students, enjoy pastimes of [naked wrestling], drinking each other's urine, and bringing the grade point [average down] by at least a full point.
		Example: [Hockey Player] 1: Dude we just lost again
		Hockey Player 2: Ya but it was close only [12-1]

		Girl #2: Ikr, he definitely goes to [Upper Canada college], [ewww]

	(2006-10-10 +114/-85)
	[UCC] a pretty wicked school. I go to St. Mike, we're rivals with UCC. The only reason I didn't go to UCC is because you need to get a 90 +  average in school AND get above 96 percentile in math and english in the [SSAT's] to be considered if you want to get in on the basis of academics. If you want to get in on a hockey only contract - its MUCH easier- you just need to be rly good at hockey, and get decent marks. I have lots of UCC friends [and they say] the school is wicked- awesome. Too bad I'm graduating next year. Whatever, St. Mike is a decent school, I guess. YEAH [ST. MIKES]. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH.
		Example: [ST. MIKES] kid: Hey I have 3 girlfriends for the BSS dance
		
		[Upper Canada College] kid: [Whateves], I have four.
		
		ST. MIKES kid: YEAH ST. MIKES. YEAH. YEAH. YEAH. (giggity giggity)

upper class
	(2007-04-17 +147/-51)
	Contrary to what many think, the "upper class" is not always the richest of the rich, and they are not necessarily conservative.
	
	For example, [Bill Gates], despite being one of the richest men on the planet, does not really fit in with the traditional American [upper crust].  As far as politics, [the Boston] Brahmins, who are the epitome of "upper class," were liberal.
		Example: "Jackie [Onassis] was upper class but poor." - [Paul Johnson], in his book A History of the [American People]

	(2004-04-30 +69/-134)
	The richest of [the rich]. Those who need not work again. Diveded into [new money] and [aristocracy]. Always conservative.
		Example: [Move out] of [the way], the upper class want you [house].

	(2011-07-09 +196/-93)
	The Upper Class defines many different subspecies of humans (despite the small percentage of the population) of mainly two areas, [Old Money] and [New Money].
	
	The first species (Homo Republicanus) generally consists of [old money]. Homo Republicanus are generally very stubborn and angry and shouldn't be interacted with directly. They complain that the working class (they are called working for a reason) need to get off their lazy asses and should get harvard diplomas, afterall the upper class are working hard playing golf and paying their servants. Homo Republicanus believes that the liberals are communist and consider anyone below them in social class to be filthy peasants.
	
	The second species ([Nouveau riche] [Anubis]) consists of more [new money]. Bill Gates would be an example, as well as many other people that have worked hard to become rich. Many people in this group are discriminated against by species such as Homo Republicanus because they aren't inbred and because they "intentionally" weren't born into the Upper Class. Although "new money" generally has more importance than Homo Republicanus because most of them have contributed to society instead of inherit wealth.
		Example: "Ew! Mother, why are we driving through a [landfill]?"- A young Upper Class person driving through an [upper-middle class] neighborhood in a lamborghini
		
		"Those liberal [commies]. Why should the poor people have rights and taxes lower than us?"- An Upper Class Homo-republicanus complaining about people with less money than him

	(2014-01-07 +16/-45)
	Rich dickheads that care only for money and are selfish. They don't care about anyone lower than them and they will shelter their offspring to the point where their offspring turns up their noses at the lower class, to the point of where the lower class usually gets out whatever weaponry they have to hand and bludgeons the [upper class] offspring. [Upper class] people are usually to be found throwing events of high social status such as garden parties and [lavish] functions such as those, which are best avoided.
	
	Upper class people are also highly bigoted and will boast of how good they are to every single person around them who is rich and idiotic enough to believe that bullshit. They like to spend [heaps on] unnecessary shit like designer clothes, latest toys/gadgets, fast cars.
		Example: Ricky: 'Did you see that upper class person on the news the other day? She was complaining about how the poor people make her [house smell] with all their filth.'
		[Dicky]: 'Next time she complains I'll [go round] to her house and break her nose.'

	(2008-10-23 +19/-24)
	A promiscuous young girl, who has the body & [the smarts]. This girl can, will & has "won" or "stolen" [the boyfriend] of another girl who obviously wasnt good enough! Because the new gf is better than the last one, the [boyfreind] left the old gf for the much better new one. But of course the old (before) gf "tries" her best to make a come back, so she calls the new (after) gf a whore. 
	The "Upper Class Whore" can get almost any guy she wants, but is disliked by the other girls because she knows shes better than them.
		Example: [Betsy]: "you stole my bf you bitch!"
		Lily: "he left you because [im better than you]!"
		Betsy: " your just a Whore!!"
		Lily: "A [upper class whore] obviously which i take pride in!"
		

	(2011-07-02 +205/-45)
	The [Upper Middle Class] doesn't start at $60,000 household income. Unless you live in Kansas or South Dakota, $60k per household doesn't get you very far in the typical metro area where most Americans live today. $60k per family is [squarely] middle class.
	
	The [upper middle class] is better described as the Professional or Managerial Class, and consists of mostly white collared professionals or successful small business owners. Typical professions in the upper middle class are [biglaw] lawyers, physicians, dentists, accountants, consultants, school principals, and engineers with managerial roles. Many have advanced degrees beyond college.
	
	They tend to live in cities during their 20s, marry in their late 20s or early 30s, and move to wealthy suburbs with good school districts when the kids come. The political affiliations of the upper middle class vary greatly with age and region in the country. Among the upper middle class, there is often a strong emphasis on education and getting into the right college for their children, to the point of obsession (see [helicopter parents]).
	
	Household incomes vary from $100k to $500k. Most upper middle class families still depend on salary and their [day job] to sustain their lifestyle (hence they are not Upper Class which relies more on investment & rent income). The upper middle class are the heaviest taxed group in America (whereas those in the upper class have more of their income in [capital gains], which has a lower tax rate).
		Example: [In America], the poor thinks they are in the [middle class] and the middle class thinks they're in the [upper middle class], while the upper middle class thinks they're typical middle class Americans.

	The [upper middle class] is better described as the Professional or Managerial Class, and consists of mostly white collared professionals or successful small business owners.

Many have advanced degrees beyond college.

The political affiliations of the upper middle class vary greatly with age and region in the country. Among the upper middle class, there is often a strong emphasis on education and getting into the right college for their children, to the point of obsession (see [helicopter parents]).
	
	Household incomes vary from $100k to $500k.

	Beautiful...beautiful...[Michigan Tech] - we like it cold, [NMU] - the kids down south, [Lake Superior] State - heck we're frickin' Canadian
		Example: [Michigan upper peninsula] is home to the [good things] in life like [pasties].

	(2017-11-01 +19/-27)
	Located directly above the lower peninsula of Michigan, it's probably the most ignored piece of land in all of America. Constantly being left out of maps and, well, every conversation ever, [the UP] specializes in producing extremely sheltered human beings. However boring it might be up here, there are some things that we are incredibly good at. Those things would be racism, [drug abuse], and no cell phone service. So, if you're a [white supremacist] looking for a nice vacation for the whole family, feel free to hop on over to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, you won't regret it.
		Example: [I do] not recommend [coming] to the Upper Peninsula of Michigan if you are not white, you will most likely get stared down in any and every [public] place.

upper perk
	(2016-03-09 +61/-2)
	A small district in Pennsylvania known for being predominantly white, spending more money on sports [fields] than [school supplies], and [crashing] cars into houses.
		Example: [Steve]: Want to go to [Upper Perk] this [weekend]?
		John: Bro, where even is that?

	(2016-12-04 +19/-1)
	A small and cheap district in [southeastern] Pennsylvania. Many of it's residents do drugs or are lazy, racist, and [unsuccessful]. It is only really known for crimes that occur, such as a [killing spree], drug busts, and pedophiles.
		Example: Person 1: Where did you grow up?
		Person 2: [Upper Perk].
		Person 1: Huh? Oh you mean [that place] with the murder [spree] last year?

	(2018-10-02 +13/-0)
	*That* school, the high school in which there's fires, mold, [bed bugs], & vaping presentations, all in the course of the first 5 weeks. [Spin the wheel] to find out [what'll] happen next week on "Only Upper Perk"!
	
	Oh and now there's supposedly snakes at one of the elementary schools. For F@#%'s sake...
		Example: Steve: Ya wanna go to the [football game] at Upper Perk tonight?
		[Chad]: Upper Perk... Oh... That school...
		Steve: Yeah [let's not]...
		Chad: ...
		Steve: ...

	(2018-07-05 +11/-1)
	Like the other two definitions have stated, [Upper Perk] is a small school district in rural Pennsylvania. If you’re reading this you either go to [Upper perk] and want to see how people defined it, you live near it, or you have no idea what it is. Upper Perk is predominately white, I believe about [91]% white (so not very diverse). The school is a place where the bathrooms are really used for [juuling] rather than it’s original purpose. The students can mostly be separated into two categories; those who are either racist, lazy, unmotivated, rednecks, or stoners, or then there are those who are smart, motivated (at least somewhat), and want to do something successful with their lives. In the end, as a student you either end up [staying in] Upper Perk forever, or are continuously drawn back to it, or you try to get away from it. As much as we may complain about our school district, most of us realize it’s actually not all that bad. There are [perks] to going to a small school in a rural location.
		Example: [Student]: I hate Upper Perk. I want to move away.
		Other Student: Bro, you’d die in another [school]. It’s [really not] that bad.

Upper Saddle River
	(2007-01-01 +102/-56)
	This is one of the richest towns in one of the richest counties in America. It is home to mostly "new money" people. The [old money] is hard to come by, but it's easy to tell. Kids from old money parents will never brag about anything. There are probably about 10 of them in the entire town. The rest are all slutty japs with big tits, but most of them are silicone. But don't squeeze them or she'll have daddy sue you for all you've got, and then buy her a new nose with it. All the girls here have at least one coach, gucci, db, or [prada bag] for every day of the week. guys, your favorite store should be [j crew] and if [you don't own] at least ten things that say northface on it, you will never get a girl. if your family doesn't have more cars than drivers, a pool, an in [home movie] theater, or at least 3 other properties across the world, you're POOR. GET OUT before everyone finds out and talks shit about you, but they probably do anyway. This town is full of daddies who work in NYC "the city" and mommies who stay at home buying [manolo] shoes for their bitchy daughters all day. It breeds some of the smartest kids in the state even though they just text each other on their new [razr] cell phones during class all day. This town makes the [Northern Highlands] parking lot glitter, where the students have better cars than the teachers. If daddy didn't buy you a lexus, bmw, or audi, he probably doesn't love you. Take all the money in your trust fund and buy a new daddy! Unless of course he pimped out some other ride for you like a land rover, high end jeep, or hummer equipped with gps and chrome all over the place. If you crash your car, you'll probably get a more expensive one tomorrow. When you meet someone from this town, they will immediately tell you how great they are because they have sooo much stuff and their parents are sooo rich. If they don't brag to you about everything in the first 10 seconds, they are probably old money and actually have some class, that's a [package deal] right there. This town is full of [jappy] bitches and [wiggas]. What a great place to live!
	
		Example: Cop: You were going 50mph over the speed limit, that's a $300 fine
		
		[USR] kid: UGHHH!! [WHAAAAT]! ummm well it's ok, i'm from Upper Saddle River, wait can daddy put that on his [amex]?

upper South
	(2006-11-12 +56/-31)
	Well contrary to that definiton above me the [Upper South] is an unoffical region of the United States. It's a region that while it is Southern is Southern to a less degree than [the Deep South]. The states that automatically come to one's mind are Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. I few pending states are North Carolina (might be too Southern), West Virginia, and Maryland. This region usually refered to as the Mid-South. During a major survey called to Southern focus survey to see the percentage of residence in the Southern states that identify with the South, the Deep South had over 90% (which also included North Carolina and Tennesee) of their residence's identifing with the South Kentucky and Virginia had 86% of their residences identifing with the South. Maryland on the other hand had less than have of their residence identifing with the South. The city's that define this region are Memphis, Louisville, Nashville, [Richmond, Virginia] Beach,
		Example: The point I'm trying to make is that some people like Kentucky yank and all the other pro Northern [peopleish] (could just be one person) are very misleading when it comes to Kentucky. They are so quick to name Kentucky as Midwestern, when it's the complete opposite from places like Minnesota and Wisconsin. I mean honestly calling those states [Kentucky's] sister states over ALabama or North Carolina is completely historically inaccurate. Kentucky is purely a [Upper South] State identical to Tennesse and Virginia, not no damn Ohio, or Indiana honestly give me a break those yankees states have nothing to do with Kentucky, aside from Southern Indiana being apart of the Louisville Metro area.

	(2005-12-12 +47/-48)
	Geographic location located in southern Ohio and Indiana, Kentucky, West Virginia that is culturally and sociologically the Upper South as opposed to the midwest, the east or the north. This would include Dayton and Cincinnati Ohio, Indianapolis, Louisville and Lexington Kentucky and Huntington, West Virginia. This is the bottom buckle of the snow belt and the top buckle of the Bible belt, where people may eat [Cincinnati Chili], stewed tomatoes, [goetta] (a pork sausage that includes pin-cut oats,) [Ale-8-1] pop (a beverage made in Winchester, KY) Esther Price chocolate candies, Mike-Sells and [Grippo] potato chips. They eat at places like [Frisch's] Big Boy and Skyline Chili and there are actually still drive-in theaters in this region. Regional pizza favorites are LaRosa's, Cassanos and Marions in southwest Ohio. Soft drinks are referred to as pop as opposed to soda or Coke. The main grocery establishement is Kroger. 
		Example: "I was passing through the Upper South on my way to Cleveland, so hit three [Kroger] stores, where bought some Ale-8-one in Lexington and some [Grippos] in Cincinnati. Then I stopped in Dayton for some Esther Price and Cassanos and picked up a copy of "Southern Living" magazine before I headed to the [frozen north].

Upper St. Clair
	(2008-09-13 +253/-187)
	Upper St. Clair is a wealthy suburb in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Upper St. Clair is known for snobby rich kids and hot “milfs”. The typical Upper St. Clair student can be found acting as if he is from the "ghetto", yet their [tinted windows] are the darkest thing that they have seen. Every kid from 7th to [12th grade] talks of smoking weed but the closest any of them have gotten to grass is their freshly cut, Mexican made, perfect [front lawn]. It is a place where your older brother determines your popularity and status in life; for instance when one student is faced with a fight from one of the neighboring community the common response will be “Do you know my brother” or “Yo I will get my brotha up in here.” Upper St. Clair is known for better looking girls then the neighboring communities, with their [fake hair] always colored dark to support their poor athletic programs. Although, There has been success in the past, Render is still one of the most useless coaches you can find, but rival [Mt. Lebanon] and other communities, that share the same hatred, still continue to tower over them in basketball and lacrosse.   
		Example: Upper St. Clair Students: "Yo dog you be hittin the bong today"
		"Ya man we's be doin'this shit all day"
		[Mt. Lebanon] Student: "Wait your still white"

	Not to mention their sexy girls, and good looking guys. [upper St clair] has no competition to beat because they are the best of the best. People who in in USC do not know what broke is , they think its when their private jet breaks down. they are known for their model like girls and successful school, and the stuck up ppl that dont associate with anyone who does not make a million a year.
		Example: Boy: Damn girl [where you from]?

Upper West Side
	(2011-03-22 +50/-15)
	The Manhattan neighborhood west of the upper (59th street) and lower (110th street) bounds of [Central Park]. Between the [Upper East Side] and [Park Slope] in character. Its 220,000 residents (although best understood by Avenue/subdivision of the neighborhood) are:
	- White and often Jewish, some blacks and hispanics (most heavily on Amsterdam Avenue and Columbus Avenue north of 86th street), Asians over-represented but not hugely
	- Upper-middle class, lawyers, doctors, bankers (though fewer of the ultra-elite top .01% than the Upper East Side) successful writers, artists, musicians who tend to be more established/less cutting-edge and in their 30s or older (and if younger, they're more often than not associated in some way with [Columbia University])
	- Fairly mixed, though the wealthiest tend to be on Central Park West (esp. the closer to 59th street) Riverside Drive & [West End] Avenue ([most esp]. in the 70s, but throughout)
	- Family-oriented & responsible, lots of kids, not too many people in their 20s
	- Internationally aware and oriented
	- Often entitled, though many are aware of it. Cultured, well-educated, quick to make it known. Perhaps highest New Yorker and New York Times readership per capita anywhere. Standard-bearers of liberal establishment. Stodgier and less at the cultural forefront than they'd like to believe. Not arrogant, but pleased with themselves, can come off as obnoxious. Take privilege somewhat for granted. Overall good people.
		Example: Sheila is the prototype Upper West Side mom: She's a [half-Jewish], half-WASP, Ivy-educated lawyer married to a doctor, she's got two kids in a stroller who are going to a good private school, orders from [Fresh Direct] but makes constant trips to [Zabar's], North Face fleece and New Balance running shoes, goes to regular dinner parties and the kids' school functions, likes work and is successful but always balances it with family life

	(2005-05-21 +130/-59)
	The best place to live in NYC. Just as rich but not as [snobby] as the [east side] of [Manhattan].
		Example: [west side] [rox my sox]

	(2005-08-24 +82/-98)
	A neighborhood in [Manhattan] that thinks it is less [snobby]/wealthy than the [Upper East Side], when in fact it's EXACTLY THE SAME.
		Example: "Yo, is [that person] from the [Upper East side]?"
		
		"[Dunno], either that or the Upper West Side, I can't tell"

	(2005-03-24 +42/-172)
	An [inferior] version of the [Upper East Side]. It is for retards, like [Michael Moore].
		Example: [East Side] baby! New York for life! I'm never moving to boring [Long Island]/[Connecticut]!!!

	(2005-04-26 +169/-67)
	between 60th and 116th streets on the west side of [new york city], clearly it is the best place to live. definately NOT as [snobby] and obnoxious as the [upper east side].
		Example: [theres] a [party on] the upper west side [tonight]...must be good.

	(2006-05-12 +48/-125)
	The upper west side is if not the BEST place to resid in NYC!!! It is beautiful, has beautiful people, and yes..i admit they are extremly rich or nuavo rich..but hey it is full of rich families. Just because you live there does not mean you are snobby. I attend a prep school, live in a [penthouse suite] with my own [doorman] on the UWS- and i am not snobby at all. I am a prep, and a true preppy isn't snobby. We are just unapproached and that is a common miscoseption about [preppies]..
		Example: The upper west side is one of the best places you'll ever [go in] your life! It roxz and if you can afford to live there you should, ITS the BEST part of the whole of [Manhattan] , actually in [NYC]..Come visit us! 

	(2004-11-19 +11/-4)
	Some who lives in the northern part of Manhattan (New York City) north of West [96th Street] (mainly the neighborhoods of Harlem, [Washington Heights], and [Inwood])

upper white trash
	(2006-02-08 +97/-45)
	A slur used to describe persons, specifically North Americans, of [European descent] who, relative to and in spite of their middle-class income, possess a remarkable lack of cultured behavior.  Behavioral characteristics of upper white trash generally include a prediliction toward blatant and unrefined self-centered materialism, a distinct lack of [social responsibility], and a profoundly inward world view, most often distinguished by rashly-decided [politically conservative] beliefs, often based on one issue such as taxes.
		Example: Despite their healthy double incomes and a substantial inheritance, [the Johnson's], a stereotypically upper white trash family, were not interested in living in a character home in a well-established neighborhood near the university, but preferred to build a McMansion with a peculariarly ostentatious two-storey grand entryway in a new suburban tract where, despite there being 3 feet between the houses, there would be plenty of space in the four-car garage to park their Escalade, [Lincoln Navigator], jet skis, ski boat, and where there would be plenty of space in the game room for a 15 seater hot tub with built-in plasma tv and flashing LED lights for their Nascar parties, and where they would be closer to the local two-year community college where their kids could go rather than spend money to fund the "liberal" [ivory towers] of the four-year university, and finally where they'd be closer to the malls and those [big fun] megachurches where no gay marriages will ever take place.

Upperclassmen
	(2009-07-19 +272/-64)
	(high school) [Upperclassmen] are the 2 highest grades of high school. The [Juniors], and the seniors. Juniors and Seniors are the big grades of high school. Sophomores are not yet [upperclassmen] but they're more respected than [Freshman]. Freshman look up to upperclassmen. Many Freshmen feel intimidated by upperclassmen. But its good for the Freshman to *try* to get on their good side.
		Example: The Upperclassmen and the [Freshman].......(STORY)
		
		Freshman: "Hey whats up? I heard theres a party tonight, can you tell me where its at?
		
		[Junior]: Um...Your a [freshman] right?
		
		Freshman: "Yeah"...
		
		Junior: AAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
		
		THE EEENNNDD!!

	(2009-06-29 +81/-23)
	The [Juniors] and Seniors of a high school they are attending. In other words, [eleventh] and [twelfth] graders.
	
	Often they are feared the non-upperclassmen, usually freshmen.
		Example: [Eleventh] Grader: YES! We're [eleventh] graders! That makes us [upperclassmen]!!!
		Ninth Grader: Uh-ohh.... I'm afraid of getting in the way of an upperclassmen....

	(2019-05-14 +11/-3)
	The two highest grades in High School before College. They are [Juniors] and Seniors, and are absolute [dickheads] to lowerclassmen just because they exist. However, not all are this way, but most of them that you'll meet will hate lowerclassmen for no reason. Once lowerclassmen become [upperclassmen], they want that feeling of power, and will repeat the harassment that the previous upperclassmen did to them.
		Example: Upperclassmen: Haha! You lowerclassmen are nothing but [mislead] fucktards that don't know your place! We will [pick on] you, treat you as inferiors, and make fun of you until we [leave out] of this fucking dump for good! Pick up my shit, hand it to me, and don't make us mad!

	(2007-05-20 +138/-197)
	10th,11th,and 12th graders in high school who think they have the right to be complete [assholes] and be [jerks] to all of the [freshman] just because they have been there longer.
		Example: upperclassmen:[freshman] [suck]!
		freshman:your [dating] one....

	(2010-03-15 +44/-66)
	people who are "upperclassmen" aren't immature [9th] graders. they are seniors and [juniors], or the top grades in a school. everyone other than the youngest. freshman in high school are not upperclassmen, and shouldn't call themselves upperclassmen. [6th graders] are basically the same social status as 9th graders, if not better.
		Example: "wow [7th grader] you can't be mean to me. you're talking to an upperclassmen"-freshman
		"actually you arent cool and your a freshman, not an upperlcassmen. you aren't a senior or junior, yeah your not [coool]."-7th [grader] and the rest of the world

	(2015-10-05 +12/-18)
	The [older people] in high school(usually 11th and 12th graders) that think they have the right to leave out freshmen, treat them like they [don't matter] and always telling them to fuck off. They also tend to get [lazy as fuck] and party their dicks and pussies all night long on Fridays and weekends.
		Example: Guy 1: Hey dude can you please [take me out] to that party that's going on this Friday?
		Guy 2: Dude, what grade are ya in?
		Guy 1: Freshman...
		Guy 2: [HAHAHAHA]!!! I'm part of the upperclassmen!!! [Fuck outta here] dude!!! Go home!!!

		Example: [That bitch] [pissed] me off,  so I upperdecked her [shitter]

	(2004-08-31 +493/-117)
	The [upperdecker] is a prank that you can pull on a friend or loved one, or more likely someone who deserves it.  An upperdecker is defined as defecating in the [upper tank] of a toilet, allowing it to [fester] for as long as possible and sending a chilling brown residue into the bowl upon each flush.
		Example: At a party where they [run out] of beer one might like to leave an "[upperdecker]" to show their [disapproval].

	(2006-08-05 +58/-15)
	This one takes practice. This maneuver requires a toilet with a tank above it, like the ones in most homes. Instead of [crapping] in the bowl, you shit [in the tank]. Now don't flush. When the following victim flushes, the rancid waste fills the bowl. If you play your cards right, it may [ferment]. Great prank for those lame partys. 
		Example: "I gave that toilet a nice [upperdecking], [Just wait] till she comes [outta there]"

	(2005-09-02 +130/-43)
	A [vengeful] act of defacating [in the tank] of a toilet so as to odorize the bathroom with every flush for weeks until found. This is usually done at parties where you don't like the host/[hostess].
		Example: "everytime I [flush the toilet] my bathroom [wreaks], someone must have left an upperdecker, when I said the parties over [go home]..OH man! they did."

upskirting
	(2006-07-03 +125/-41)
	A relatively new practise where someone (usually a [pervy] guy) takes pictures up a girls skirt unbeknownst to her using his mobile phone or camera. You can find pictures of this kind published on the internet. There's a theory that it's the act of [taking the picture] whilst the victim is unaware that gives the photographer [the thrill], and not in fact the poor quality photograph it results in.
		Example: "Why is that guy [holding] his hand out and [grinning]?"

upspeak
	(2006-06-01 +202/-51)
	[Affliction] affecting my in today's society not just teenagers where a person makes a question out of a sentence that isn't a question (or more simply speaks "up" at the end of a sentence). Huge part of most American and European accents. In some languages such as French or [Spainish] it is actually required as part of the accent but has seeped into the English language perverting the grammar of sentences, annoying the hell out of some and showing the widespread influence of US TV like Friends and [Sex and the City] on accents (particularly in the UK and Ireland)
		Example: Example 1: "Well our [windfall] would probably be 4000? By this time next year?"
		
		Example 2: "Mom no way can I go out like that. I'd look, like, so..stupid?"

Upstate
	(2007-09-09 +135/-37)
	The meaning of [Upstate], New York:
	
	Residents of northern [New York State] - the true Upstate region - know that the state consists of several regions. Namely, [upstate], [downstate], western (Buffalo and Rochester), central (Syracuse and [Utica]), and the city. (I like to think of Long Island as an orbiting moon, but it is better classified as a different planet all together.)  
	
	Albany is barely on the edge of Upstate, Poughkeepsie is NOT Upstate, and [Newburgh] is definitely NOT Upstate. It may be hard to fathom, but not everything in the state of New York revolves around the city, so therefore, everything above the city/Westchester is not Upstate. 
	
	Admittedly, Upstate may be "different" than New York City and other regions, but it is a term of pride, not a term of derision.  Many ignorant downstaters (who probably don't recycle and drive Hummers) may not realize that Upstate is home to the Adirondack Mountains and the most beautiful natural areas of [New York state].  Always remember, not only does New York State have the largest, most culturally diverse, most amazing city on the east coast, it also has the largest tracts of pristine, protected wilderness lands east of the Mississippi in the northern, Upstate regions.
	
	New York State is amazing, from top to bottom!
		Example: "Hey, wanna do something this weekend?"
		
		"[No thanks], I am going Upstate to my [cabin] on [Lake George]."
		
		"Oh wow, you are so lucky!  It is gorgeous up there."
		
		"I know."

	[Upstate] is a term used by people who live in New York City or the surrounding metro area. [Long Islanders] and some city people consider the Northern suburbs (Westchester, [Rockland]) to be [upstate] because they are north of where they are and think [thaty] for some reasons the cultural and economic ties spread east. Northern suburbs consider anywhere above them to be upstate (mostyl Poughkeepsie and up). Whats funny is that people from "upstate" cities such as Albany, Binghamton, Syracuse, Rochester or Buffalo have no concept of what "upstate is. Albany is the Capital District. Binghamton is the Southern Tier. Syraucse is Central New York. Rochester is near the Finger Lakes and Buffalo is in Western New York. In the end Upstate doesn't really exist and is generally a term used to imply that you live south of the area being discussed.
		Example: Everything north of [Westchester] is [upstate] ([Rockland] is west of Westchester bordering New Jersey and the the northern tip of Westchester is above Rockland. So Rockland is not upstate.)

	(2003-07-28 +61/-41)
	A place [too far] [north] in [NYS] for a tough New Yawka like you to know or care about.
		Example: 

	(2008-10-04 +20/-11)
	Any of [New York State] not including New York City, Long Island, or [Westchester] or [Rockland] Counties.  
		Example: The Adirondacks, the [Albany] region, same with Buffalo, Rochester and [Syracuse], and whatever of [New York state] more than 45 minutes away from New York City or Long Island is referred to as Upstate New York.

	(2002-12-23 +94/-84)
	[The real] [New York].
		Example: I'm from Upstate... yeah you know [New York] where where [crackers] live and everyone doesn't [speak] prohanese.

	(2003-11-26 +28/-27)
	People who think they're [from New York] until they go to college and realize [that all] the downstaters think the world ends after [Yonkers].
		Example: I was driving west on the [Tappan Zee Bridge] heading [upstate] and when it was already too late realized the bridge was emptying [into the pit] of oblivion.

	(2003-11-12 +18/-22)
	[Anything] [north] of the [Tappan Zee Bridge]

Upstate New York
	(2012-01-15 +328/-106)
	1. Your idea of a traffic jam is 10 cars waiting to pass a tractor
	3. You measure distance in hours
	4. You know several people who have hit deer more than once
	6. You stay in your house most of the summer because you aren't used to the heat
	7. You drive at 55 mph through 10 feet of snow during a raging blizzard without [flinching]

	14. Driving is better in the winter because the potholes are [filled in] with snow
	16. You know [4 seasons]: almost winter, winter, cold, construction
	19. Cows are just part of the scenery
	22. You know that the phrase, "Goin up ta," applies to going north, south, east, or west, up or down in elevation, and pretty much any other way you can travel.
	23. The smell of freshly spread cow manure doesn't bother you.
	26. Halloween costumes are always designed around a snowsuit and winter boots.
	31. You can name everyone you graduated with.
	42. You still go home for Homecoming.
	58. Your teachers call you by your [older sibling's] name.
	64. You have to name six surrounding towns to explain to people where you're from.
	67. When somebody says "Thats billy [fucillo HUGE]" you know exactly what they are talking about
	I don't agree with the people saying upstate starts just [noth] of NYC and Long Island, It is more the Finger Lakes and north regions, maybe some of the southern tier but I am pretty sure they have their own set of rules there.
		Example: Upstate New Yorker: Oh wow, look we got over two feet of snow last night! Good thing I have [four wheel drive]!
		New York City Person: Holy Crap and inch of snow! Mom, we have a snow day right? Snow like this is dangerous!
		
		Upstate New Yorker: I'm from [Phelps], um half way between rochester and syracuse, near [geneva] and canandaguia, kind by waterloo?
		New York City Person: I am from Queens, you are a moron if you don't know where that is.

	(2009-05-21 +143/-74)
	The use of this term varies by region.
	
	- NYC + LI: North of the [Tappan Zee Bridge].*
	- Westchester: North of Westchester.
	- Lower [Hudson Valley] (Rockland, Putnam, etc.): North of Poughkeepsie.
	- Albany: North of Albany
	
	* Some people from these areas consider anything North of the Bronx to be upstate. However, (for NYC) they probably have never left their borough, or (for LI) they're jealous because Westchester is essentially a superior version of Nassau County.
	
	All that aside, the technical definition of Upstate New York, as defined by the New York State Department of Tourism, is anything North of southern [Dutchess County].
		Example: Person from Jericho: "[914]? So you're from Upstate?"
		Person from Scarsdale: "Seriously? I'm closer to Manhattan than you are. Everyone knows that Upstate New York begins above Westchester."
		Person from [Poughkeepsie]: "Hey, I'm not upstate. The [Metro-North] still reaches me, so that makes me part of the metro area."
		Person from Albany: "This is the real upstate."
		Person from Buffalo: "I live in Western New York."
		Person from Binghamton: "Westchester, is that on Long Island?"
		Person from Buffalo: "Chicken Wings."

	(2006-11-06 +161/-117)
	Seriousley... Why are all upstate people considered hicks? I do not know. I live in a town called [Lake George] which is one of the most heavily toured areas in the state. As well as one of the richest in the state. If upstate New York was a bunch of hicks do you really think that [Derek Jeter], or DMX, or Jay-Z would buy lake front mansions? [I dont think so]. Get a grip.
		Example: Upstate New York [houses] some of the richest people in the country, as well as holds some of the most beautiful [scenery] and [lakes] in the country.

	(2009-12-19 +82/-67)
	Any place in New York that is not Suffolk, Nassau, Queens, Kings, Richmond, New York, Bronx, [Rockland], Westchester, [Putnam], [Dutchess], Ulster, Orange, Sullivan, or Greene Counties.
	
	This is an equal, or far better, section of New York State. It was Upstate that saved the Union, when we kept the City and Long Island from seceding and joining the Confederacy. Upstate bleeds money into NYC, and away from itself. NYC cannot sustain itself, and so relies on Upstate for further support.
		Example: [Upstater]: I'm from Upstate New York
		[Downstater] Elitist: Oh, you must be a hick.
		Upstater: Nice assumption, idiot. Apparently you have never been in wine country, or seen the Finger Lakes. You've never been to Rochester or Buffalo. Clearly you think [you're better] because you take our money and assume you're better because you've never been outside your own little bubble.
		Downstater (thinking): Shit, I've been pwned.

	(2009-07-30 +91/-96)
	In short, a terrible place. Should be avoided at all costs.
	
	If you ever end up moving to [Upstate New York], you will never be able to escape it.
	
	The towns are all small, boring and cold and the cities are [nothing to write home about] either.
	
	However something about Upstate New York, particularly EXTREME Upstate New York will pull you back in should you ever try to leave for a prolonged period of time.
	My parents, like many other unfortunate people who grew up in Upstate New York, actually left and CAME BACK.
	
	Upstate New York will forever be in the shadow of The City, and should you move there you will be invalidated as a person entirely.
	If you ever happen to travel, and you tell someone you are from New York you will be forced to endure horrid responses like "OMGZ IZ [IT NICE] [IN DA CITY]?" or "D00D I WAz iN NYC LaSt WeEk, itz dA BoMb!!123" even if you try to take preventitive measures such as saying "New York STATE," "[UPSTATE New York]," or even "RURAL NEW YORK YOU MOTHERFUCKER."
	
	Believe it or not, there are actually places even farther north than Buffalo or Albany.
	
	I personally live within walking distance of the Canadian border.
	
	I would rather just hop across and join the Canadians than deal with another day of being seen as a hideous appendage to The City.
	
	My dream is to get the fuck out as soon as I can, move to another state and NEVER TELL ANYONE WHERE I'M ORIGINALLY FROM.
	Unfortunately that will be nearly impossible because SUPRISE, on top of being boring, cold, and ignored, Extreme Upstate New York is also [DIRT POOR].
	This forces its unfortunate inhabitants to attend crappy local colleges and then later either work at Clinton Correctional Facilities or live IN Clinton Correctional Facilities.
	
	This is partly due to the inevitable drug and alcohol problems these people develop to cope with the pain of living [in America's] own little third-world country.
		Example: Example One:
		
		Poor, unfortunate soul: I grew up in Upstate New York, and saved up all my money from the time I was a kid so someday I could get the fuck out. Unfortunately after leaving and entering the rest of the world I devoloped a slew of mental illnesses because I was never properly trained to live in society. I moved back Upstate.
		
		Example Two:
		Kid: Woah, mom, your dashboard says it's -20 degrees outside.
		Mom: [Yes dear], that's because we're driving through Upstate New York. When we get into Canada, it'll still be this cold, but at least I'll be able to smoke in public.
		
		Example Three:
		[STUPID Girl] on plane: So where are you from?
		UNFORTUNATE Guy on plane: UPSTATE RURAL [New York STATE].
		STUPID Girl on plane: Wow, that's so cool. Can you see the Statue of Liberty from your apartment, or is the Empire State Building blocking your view?
		
		Example Four:
		Man: I was going to get out of this place as soon as I could, but things [didn't work out], I had to stay in the area for college. Now I work at Clinton Correctional Facilities.
		
		Woman from Anywhere but Upstate, USA: OMG did you meet Tupac?!?
		
		Example Five:
		
		Girl on internet: I live in [Massena].
		Boy on internet in NYC: Is that like near Ethiopia?

	(2006-11-08 +65/-80)
	Upstate New York, contrary to the belief of Long Islanders, does not begin just north of the city. NYC suburbs include Rockland, Orange, Westchester, Putnam, and Lower [Dutchess] counties - including Fairfield County, CT. "Upstate" begins north of those places, when there is no longer [Metro-North] train service to [Grand Central Station].
	
	Poughkeepsie is NOT part of upstate New York. However, slightly north of Poughkeepsie (i.e., Rhinebeck) is where "upstate" actually begins. On the flip side of the Hudson, Newburgh is not upstate. Newburgh is only an hour and a half from the city. Please don't call Newburgh upstate. West of the Hudson, upstate begins in Ulster county. 
		Example: "I'm sorry, but Scarsdale is NOT upstate New York."
		
		Person from [Dutchess] meets person from Long Island:
		D: "Where are you from?"
		LI: "Lawn-Guy-Lind. You?"
		D: "[Dutchess County]...like, [Poughkeepsie]."
		LI: "...Is that upstate? What's it like in upstate NY?"
		---------------
		Person from Dutchess meets person from Renssalaer:
		D: "Where are you from?"
		R: "Albany. Well Renssalaer, but no one knows where that is....so Albany."
		D: "Oh...I'm from Poughkeepsie."
		R: "Is it warm there?"
		D: "Uh..."
		R: "You know upstate starts NORTH of the Hudson, right?"
		D: *confused*
		

	(2005-06-09 +38/-48)
	[upstate] new york does not refer to the proximity of new york city; its the entire state in general. upstate is anything north of westchester county.
	
	The 5 bouroughs, [nassau], suffolk and weschester are [downstate]. 
	
	the only debate is westchester, not because of the social/economical connections with the city, its just that its north of the bronx. But most people say that it is downstate.
	
	if you think long island is upstate then you are obviously from one of the citys bad schools or from any upstate school (north of weschester). Learn your geography! This isnt that hard! Not one person I have ever met has even knew that this was a "debate"(which its not).
		Example: Someone from [long island]/New York City: "Im going [upstate] this weekend"
		
		Friend: "your going north of [westchester]? watch out for the tractors!
		"

	(2008-02-18 +38/-51)
	The vast area encompassing New York State north of Westchester county. A varied mosaic of farmland, woodland, picturesque rolling hills, and towns and cities ranging from the charming to the decrepit. Generally more provincial and less cosmpolitan than its densely urban New York City counterpart, its citizenry is more approachable and friendly albeit less refined and cultured than the pretentious yuppies of New York and Long Island. Some of its urban centers are [buoyed] economically and culturally by the influence of many universities and (in the case of the capital region) [government administration] centers; however most of its large cities are mired in varying states of urban decay and have been hemorrhaging population since the 1950s due to a steady loss of jobs and a subsequent increase in crime. Utica, Rochester, and [Newburgh] are particularly miserable places to set foot in. Its more rural areas, which feature breathtaking landscapes, are lovely and [bucolic] albeit mind-numbingly boring to actually live in. 
	
	In summation, upstate New York is too large and varied an area to define succinctly. As a native resident of New York City who went to college upstate I can both [laud] it for being physically beautiful and its natives for being candid, frank, and hospitable while noting that I would never want to live there permanently as life there can grow trite, repetitive, [cold as hell], and insufferably boring after a while and the locals' lack of sophistication and city-esque hustle, while charming at first, can also eventually grow unflattering. Not that I'd want them to change. Their lack of tact and culture is offset by their good character and sincerity, something too many city residents and [Long Islanders] sorely do not have. Both Upstate and Downstate need each other, more or less. It's a [yin-yang] thing.
		Example: [New Yorker] 1: I'm going [upstate] for the summer.
		New Yorker 2: You'll love it in [Upstate] New York for the first few weeks. It's nice to get away from the [yuppie] assholes down here for a while. Eventually, though, you'll need to come back to civilization.

	(2010-03-07 +18/-24)
	Upstate New York refers to that portion of New York State which is not part of the New York City Metropolitan area. There is some debate as to the southernmost point of Upstate New York, but a general consensus exists that anything north of Westchester and [Rockland] Counties qualifies.
	
	Upstate New York differs from Long Island, New York City, and Westchester/Rockland in a number of ways, among them: 1) Lower [population density]; 2) Lower socioeconomic status; 3) More conservative politics; 4) Midwestern accent and culture; 5) Colder winters with much greater snow totals.
	Upstate New York has been in decline, economically, for many decades. Many of its cities, such as [Schenectady] and Buffalo, have experienced substantial de-population since the mid-20th Century. As a result, many Upstate New York residents harbor a great deal of resentment towards "Downstate".
		Example: It [snows] in Upstate New York, almost non-stop, from [November] to [April].

	People who [invent] [new words] and definitions for those words, for the sole purpose of posting them [to Urban] Dictionary.

Urban Dicktionary
	(2005-03-25 +1065/-135)
	What urban dictionary should be renamed to, as most of [the site's] definitions directly [pertain] to or [allude] to sexual affairs.
		Example: My parents never gave me a [talk about] [the birds and the bees], so I went on [urbandictionary.com] instead.

	(2020-08-04 +15/-3)
	[Urban dicktionary] is [when urban dictionary] is simply [a dick] and won't add certain words
		Example: 1: Oh I tried to [add a word] on [urban dictionary]
		2: did it work
		1: no
		2: so u mean [urban DICKTIONARY]

	(2009-06-01 +100/-38)
	What [urbandictionary] has mutated into- a bunch of [angsty teens] and haters [whining] about crap.
		Example: Dude 1: Where'd you hear that about Asians?
		
		Dude 2: Urbandictionary. Isn't it funny how they can't pronounce their [Ls]?
		
		Dude 1: Fuck that. That's [prejudiced] and not true. No wonder you heard it from [urban dicktionary].

	(2011-04-21 +96/-40)
	Where you go to [look up] which teenagers have [big dicks] and which have [small ones].
		Example: The majority of definitions in [the Urban Dicktionary] are based upon [teen] [penis envy].(both male and female)

	(2013-09-13 +11/-4)
	[When Urban Dictionary] does not [publish] a perfectly [good definition] because they are idiots.
		Example: Dude : "Posted the definition for Cunts Game last night on Urban Dictionary, got rejected."

	(2007-09-03 +35/-33)

	What [your mother] did to [find out] what you meant.
		Example: I had to [ask] [Jackie] what [FOMO] meant.
		I just urban dictionaried it.

	(2006-09-17 +7953/-637)
	[A dictionary] that, every time I [read] it, my [faith in humanity] declines a little.
		Example: Urban Dictionary is [supposedly] for [defining] [your world].

	(2021-02-04 +232/-14)
	A website where every word is sexual shit but occasionally you can find slang terms that aren’t defined on google if you ain’t with [the times] and still use the word “[tubular]” like some [boomer].
		Example: “I [tried] to use Urban Dictionary for a generally nice [seeming] word and found some [real bad] shit...”

	(2009-12-31 +2473/-244)
	A site with an amazing concept that was great up until 2005-ish. Today, 90% of Urban Dictionary is clogged with bizarre sexual acts that have fucking nothing to do with the original definitions.
	
	The site in general is poorly [moderated] and misspelled to the bone. I often wonder if the creators of this site are still alive. I don't have much of a problem with incorrect spellings, but this shit heap has redefined (no pun intended) the word "misspell"
	
	Today, 10 year olds enjoy this place the most. The small amount of definitions on here that don't relate to sex, usually relates to race or stereotypes. The [0.01]% of the normal definitions are from back when this site was decent. [Grow the fuck up], people.
		Example: (5 years ago)[Urban dictionary user]: England- A country in Western Europe with a mixed population. Invented the blah blah blah...
		(Now) Urban dictionary user: a [englend] iz wen a gril wif croooked teet bites ur dick. dis becuz [peeple] in englennd hav bad teeth frm teh tee drinkin
		
		Goodbye Urban Dictionary, you were great while you lasted...

	(2017-01-13 +7430/-797)
	The Urban Dictionary is the website you are currently on. This website wastes a lot of your time. Like right now. You are reading this definition of The Urban Dictionary instead of doing something productive. So? Why are you still reading this? [Go outside] or something. [Shoo]!
	
	HA [GOT U]! THOUGHT THE DEFINITION WAS OVER! WRONG! Who goes outsidea anymore? I mean im outside as im typing this but who cares. Well, im in a car. Does that count as outside? Can u get [jailed] for driving someone elses car without permission?
		Example: "The Urban Dictionary is [a waste] of time." - [Some Random Guy] [Online]

	(2012-10-03 +573/-54)
	[The ultimate] [site] to [procrastinate] on.
		Example: [Andrew] was doing his homework, but then started [looking up] [definitions] on Urban Dictionary.

	(2020-09-15 +1337/-145)
	A great idea initially , but its quality has drastically deteriorated year after year and continues to get worse. It was founded in 1999 by [Aaron Peckham] while he was a freshman computer science major. Shortly afterwards it became abused by mostly teenagers/ dumbass children and to a [lesser degree mentally stunted adults] (largely due to the non-existent moderater position to look over words submitted). These individuals continue to flood its space with high levels of immaturity, retardation, first names of acquaintances with definitions that don't make sense to anyone, political bias, shitty grammar, nonsensical sexual innuendo stupidity and random words with definitions [pulled out of thin air] that are not used as slang by any living being in society . On occasion you can actually find a professional input of a real slang word that is legitimate and professional. RIP URBAN DICTIONARY. "You were good while you lasted."
		Example: Urban Dictionary is garbage. Everytime I go on [this website] a piece of my heart dies and I [shed] a [tear].

	(2007-06-11 +673/-87)
	[Concrete] proof of [the degeneration] of [the human race's] collective intelligence.
		Example:  If you haven't lost your [faith in humanity] already, just spend a few minutes [browsing] Urban Dictionary. This is the next generation? Yup. We're [doomed].

	(2022-10-20 +119/-12)
	[The ultimate] online [dictionary], written by [professional] shit talkers.
		Example: [Wanna] know [the definition] of something? Urban Dictionary has you [covered].

	(2013-01-22 +24/-1)
	To [submit] a perfectly valid word definition to [urbandictionary.com], only to have it [arbitrarily] rejected.
		Example: What the hell??? You'll accept the definition of "apple: a fuckin' [fruit]", but you'll [reject] [my definition]? I got Urban Dictionaried.

Urban Dictionary 2nd Try
	(2019-01-27 +104/-308)
	[Urban Dictionary 2nd try] Is when you resubmit the exact same definition that was rejected before without changing it whatsoever

		Example: Joe: I can’t believe those idiots didn’t [publish] your awesome definition [the first time]

	Idiots who do Urban Dictionary ad hominem often times do not have sufficient imagination, vocabulary, or sense of humor to post a response.
		Example: After [posting] the definition [belgian shower], my other definitions immediately received the same amount of [dislikes]. Should have known them Belgians would do Urban Dictionary ad hominem.

	(2010-08-29 +72/-14)
	urban dictionary assholes is a term for the [editors of urban dictionary] who can't be good sports and only publish biased definitions suited to their political leanings as can be seen by [all the tea] party definitions posted and by the rejection of mine. It would have been more fun if both sides had been shown, and a sign of maturity. Why is it that wimpy people tend to be [libera] and liberals tend top be wimpyl. coincidence? nah
		Example: A: What's Urban Dictionary?
		
		B:Mostly a place [for shits and giggles]. Let's have a look...Oh this is funny. Oh this is funny, too. Hey, [wait a minute], all these answers are [identical]. Wow, let's ubmit our own defintions

	One who would maniacally or sadistically [downvote] any new entries on a daily basis, by clicking on the contributor’s username, even before they are publicly [accessible] under the [search engine], or would have them deleted.
		Example: Since last December, some [Urban Dictionary asshole] has been [downvoting] every recently approved entries submitted by [MathPlus] a dozen times every day—it’s high time the Urban Dictionary squad look into this terrorist attack, by exposing the suspected Islamist or Trump perpetrator.

_____

Urban Dictionary Bug
	(2014-01-30 +62/-3)
	A problem discovered in 2010, that one could exploit a [bug on] Urban Dictionary which allowed one to go into the source code and either up-vote or down-vote definitions hundreds of times instantly -- basically game Urban Dictionary. A few weeks after this was discovered, Urban Dictionary corrected [the bug] so that it could no longer be [exploited]. However, the definitions already affected remained with multiple fake up-votes or down-votes.
		Example: Did you see a random definition on Urban Dictionary that few people would look up yet it has [1500] up-votes? Do you see an author who has [multiple definitions] with thousands of up-votes on them all and a comparably tiny number of down-votes? Probably a result of them [exploiting] the Urban Dictionary Bug.

	(2021-05-06 +27/-0)
	A challenge created by me, in which you and another person each go on UD and press the random definition button on Urbandictionary.com, you then press any blue [highlighted] definition, and the chain goes on, definition after definition. [The trick] however, is not to land on a dirty/sexual/drug-related (depends how you play it) definition, [the last one] to land on a dirty definition wins. This game can also be played in a group.
		Example: Justanothersickfuckonurbandic: Hey guys! Let`s play this game I created, it`s called "The Urban Dictionary Challenge!"
		Kevin: Wow, Justanothersickfuckonurbandic, [what a great idea]! How is it played?
		*explains how to play*

Urban Dictionary Loser
	(2007-11-23 +331/-65)
	The kind of person who doesn't really have any knowledge of slang - or life, for that matter - but insists on posting their "definitions" on this site. The content of their posting, no matter what the subject, ALWAYS refers to at least one, if not all, of the following:
	
	1) A penis, or anything associated with penises, such as testicles, semen, urine or pubic hair. (this reference appears in just about every posting by the Loser, who will [vehemently] deny being gay, despite having an obvious and disturbing obsession with the penises of other men.)
	
	2) A "hot" female, or any part of her body. The female's sole purpose is to inevitably get "fucked" or desired to be "fucked". The Loser cannot figure out any other use for a beautiful woman, and indeed, has no experience with beautiful women anyway. (Thinking about beautiful women is not encouraged since it only takes away from [the precious] time needed to consider the penises of other men.)
	
	3) Anything related to beer (but not other forms of alcohol), professional sports, [red meat], the military strength of the [American Armed Forces], or anything else considered "manly" by the Loser.
	
	4) The word Fuck, usually repeated many times and in many variations.
		Example: The Urban Dictionary Loser is typically a white, suburban teenager or [20-something], with little life experience who sits around in front of the TV, talking shit with his friends about how great he is. You know the one, he needs to constantly [verbalize] his desire to fuck every woman that comes on TV, is always right no matter what the subject is, and has a very high opinion of himself. In fact, it might even be you and that's why you're rating this [thumbs down], because the truth hurts, doesn't it, you Urban Dictionary Loser!?!?

	(2005-04-18 +169/-59)
	A person who takes this [site] [so seriously], they sit around and actually [define] these words!
		Example: Everyone who uses this [site], including me right now, is [an Urban Dictionary] [Loser]

	(2005-04-26 +67/-22)
	This is a group of people who [submit] stupid deffintions to the [UD].

urban exploration
	(2003-09-24 +455/-89)
	The act of going places you're not supposed to go. "[Urban exploration]" acts as an umbrella phrase for other terms like infiltration, draining, [buildering] and other actions which take place in an urban setting.

	Also known as "[urban adventure]" and "ue".
		Example: "There's an [abandoned] factory. Are you up for some urban exploration?"

	Take nothing but pictures...
	Leave nothing but [footprints]...
	Break nothing but silence...
	
	Although this rule is commonly broken in a way that people will sometimes take items for a personal souvenier.  This is something that does not bother most unless things are taken in mass quantities for a profit.
		Example: Hey, what do you want to do today?
		-How about we go to that [abandoned] hospital to take some cool pictures!

Born in [Redwood City], California, the son of Stella Gengania and Romeo Dina, and is of Filipino descent. As a small child he had been exposed to hip-hop music by his brother Daryl Gengania-Dina, who was in his teenage years. As a young child, he became interested in hip-hop, performing and lip singing to artists such as Biggie, 2pac, and Eminem. Around the age of twelve Irvin had found the ambition to rap, and was under the name “[D-Money]“ and created the group “[A-Unit]“ around 2005, where his first song was written but not released. Within junior high school, he frequently was challenged in freestyle battles.
	
	Through he would later struggle with the nature of his minuscule fame, as well as lyrical expectations, The Urban endured substantial obstacles throughout his young yet remarkably dramatic entrance into the rap game. Before becoming one of the most lyrical Asian rappers among his friends, being compared to rappers such as 50 cent, The Urban had suffered through hatred and harsh critics which the eye of ignorance had given him. Entering the hip hop game, The Urban had been exposed to negative comments from his peers, which pulled him out of the game for a while. Not knowing what he was putting himself into, he decided to take a break and learn the story behind Hip Hop. [Stepping back] into the game in the summer of 2008, he is experienced and ready for anything, following one of his goals to be a respected MC. Hoping to make it one day. 
		Example: Guy 1: Hey, did you listen to The [Urban's] new [remix]?

		Example: [Oooh], [I love that dress] at Urban Outfitters. Better start saving my money.
		
		
		[Who the fuck] spends $60 on a ruined pair of shorts?!

	(2011-05-09 +81/-29)
	A store that tries to mass produce the "thrift store vintage look." My question is what's [cool about] buying mass produced "poser" vintage? People who started [the thrift] store movement did it to make a statement against "brands" in general, and corporate America. Urban Outfitters is a publicly traded company on the stock market and all they care about are their sales, and keeping investors happy. A [far cry] from being "indie" or "underground." I would much rather support a local thrift store then, try to obtain that stolen, exploited look from these guys.
		Example: That's a cool [tye dye] shirt, did you make it? No, I [bought it] for $[112] at Urban Outfitters. It's a good thing I own stock in the company, they know how to exploit the youth, and making them believe they are indie, and underground.

	(2007-03-28 +441/-225)
	A fashionable store with (i'll admit) slightly over-priced clothing. But, hey if somone has the money to buy a certain pair of jeans or a couple shirts they like, then they should be able to buy them without being ridiculed like some of you low-lifes here who love to [lable] people into certain groups. I like going [to Urban] Outfitters because it offers clothing and styles not seen at 'all-american' clothing stores such as American eagle or Abercrombie and Fitch. (Nothing wrong with those stores btw, they're just going for a different look.) Urban Outfitters also has clothing that is [affordable]. 
		Example: Hey i went [to Urban] Outfitters to get a unique [belt] and nice looking [jacket]! 

	(2010-10-18 +23/-11)
	An [overrated] urban store which sells nothing but strange yet quirky stuff suitable for those who either prefer not to be labled but are labled anyway or [preps] attempting to show their [deep side].
		Example: OMG Urban Outfitters everything is so cool and unique and I might [fool] myself into thinking I have a sense of [individualism] if I [shop] here!

	(2009-07-26 +20/-10)
	A store that was actually founded in Philadelphia in 1970. It is a store catering to the urban taste with upscale names. Their stores are in select locations that are "urban" enough for [the company's] standards. It is very popular amongst [indie people], hipsters, and artsy people. Though the first Urban Outfitters on Walnut St in Philly is now an [Anthropologie], it still has awesome clothes!
		Example: Woman 1: Did you know Urban Outfitters was founded in Philadelphia?
		
		Woman 2: Thank goodness [for tax] free shopping there!
		
		Gay Man: Urban Outfitters has [such cute] clothes when I'm feeling [artsy]!

	(2008-03-17 +112/-79)

		Example: Girl 1: WOW!  I love the way you paired those blue [fishnets] with that oversized [neon green] sweater, gold chains, and rainbow Adidas hi-tops!  Where'd you get that stuff?
		
		Girl 2: URBAN OUTFITTERS!  I'm so artsy and urban and unique!  I should have [Cobrasnake] and Terry Richardson take my picture!

	(2008-12-27 +64/-42)
	A place where people who are [trying to be cool] and creative with what they wear buy all of their clothing so they can look "different" from everyone else. 
	Mostly "indie" people buy their highly priced clothing from there. 
	[Urban outfitters] is The Man for people trying to be creative. While other truly creative people go out and shop for their clothes at [thrift] stores for one of a kind pieces. Or better yet make their clothing.
		Example: Jessica: omg i just got this really cute different shirt at Urban Outfitters...
		
		[Lauren]: ohh really!? i bet you [everyone and their mother] are going to [have it] at school tomorrow...
		

	(2010-06-01 +15/-10)
	A store in which you can buy the same clothes imported from china and sold for a tenth of the price in nearby street markets, including east street in Elephant and [Castle]. Some of it is pretty, but definitely pretty overpriced considering the cost price. [bit of a] [flea market].
		Example: I have that very same top! Where did you [buy it], [urban outfitters]?
		
		No, [east] street for £3.50.

	(2005-07-17 +198/-221)
	A store popular with kids who were picked on in High School and now wrap their identity around expensive T-shirts that have funny little sayings in cute colors. Employees usually listen to Bright Eyes and cry when they masturbate. Was founded on hippie ideals of [free love] and cheap clothing, but now sells Lacoste, Diesel, and jeans with holes and bleach stains that cost hundreds of dollars. Misleads shoppers, making them believe they are special, unique, or funny because of an asymmetrical collar or [Led Zepplin] logo. Distracts customers with bright colors and [decor] so they don't realize they are actually paying $150 for a [beanbag] chair.
		Example: "Everybody loves a Jewish/[Catholic]/Irish/Redheaded/Asian/[Fat girl]! HAHA I am so clever! I'm really going to turn heads tonight at [The Killers] concert!"

Urban pimps do not dress like the old genration of pimps. They wear brand new clothing lines like [PW], have loose clothes, have bling and the biggest change, have more respect for their woman. Urban pimps can be doing the same activity as G's but have the brains to know how to create buisness and have a real rep for themselves while not falling in a less-than-hip class.

Urban Planet
	(2004-08-13 +215/-52)
	Canadian chain store based in Montreal, as all Canadian clothing stores, are and situated all over Canada (and in the US now too). A more expensive, higher-quality version of Stitches, which is a store that sells utterly crap hip-hop/skater clothing. Basically, Urban Planet has 4 brand labels: Urban Planet, Sirens, Seduction, and Whisper. They sell clothes of all styles, from preppy to hip-hop to vaguely goth, for very affordable prices. The service at some stores (eg the [Promenade] Mall [superstore] in [Thornhill], ON) is pretty shitty though, although other stores make up for that. Urban Planet is probably the most risque of all Canadian clothing stores and sells a lot of "out-there" items (eg. [micro mini] skirts, very low-cut [halter] tops, and tank tops that say "Looking for a man"), but you can get some gorgeous, non-designer, punk/goth-looking stuff there very cheap, so I love it.
		Example: I just bought a green [striped] top (like that girl on [the NIN] [webcam] wore) at Urban Planet. It cost me $5 (like $3.50 US for all you Americans). How amazing is that?

urban red neck
	(2005-12-25 +57/-8)
	Although the idea of an [Urban Redneck] would at first seem an oxymoron, they do exist and are actually quite common. There are basically three different kinds of Urban Rednecks.
	
	1) The Transplanted Redneck is found in urban centers all over the world. His job or his dreams have forced him to leave his native community in search of new opportunities. The Transplanted Redneck remains true to himself and his culture, despite [immersion] in the urban landscape. A transplanted redneck, or pair of rednecks, may raise a family in the city and retain their redneck characteristics for several generations.
	
	2) [The Poser] is found all over North America, but is especially concentrated in cities in the Southern United States, Nevada and Utah. These individuals may have no Redneck roots, or even be a transplanted [Yankee], but either seek acceptance in their new homes, or have [vastly] distorted perceptions of the social norms in their adopted communities. The Urban Cowboy phenomenon that started in the 1980s is characterized by individuals in full country & western [garb], that have never even been near a horse.
	
	3) The [Postmodern] Redneck is also found all over North America. The Postmodern Redneck may, or may not, have Redneck roots. As opposed to "The Poser", the Postmodern Redneck has experienced a philosophical transformation in which he rejects [modernism] and [urbanity], in favor of simpler more genuine way of life. The Postmodern Redneck is often an educated professional who owns guns, hunts wild game, and isn't afraid to get his hands dirty changing oil or cleaning a stable.
		Example: "Billy Bob got a job in Chicago but he's having trouble adjusting to life as an urban red neck."
		
		"The kids at school think it's cool to wear big belt [buckles], cowboy hats and drive big trucks.  But their just urban [red necks] with a trust fund."

Urban Word Of The Day
	(2010-12-04 +74/-9)
	a daily, often [flimsy] and apparently unmoderated attempt at [humor], hipness or [wordplay].
		Example: I just posted [the first thing] that [popped] into [my head] and miraculously it became Urban Word Of The Day.

	(2009-06-05 +49/-12)
	A daily email sent to those on the Urban Dictionary [newsletter] [mailing] list. The 'Urban Word of the Day' is the word and definition selected for [the day's] newsletter. Most of these receive instant thumbs downs, as they are somewhat random, and most of the good words on this site are already taken.
		Example: As of today, 'SOML', 'iflml', and 'going multiball' are the three latest 'Urban [Word of the Day's]. Each has at least twice as many [downward] [thumbs] as there are thumbs up.

	While many who receive this e-mail take pleasure in learning something humorous each day, inevitably it becomes an annoyance when the recipient doesn't check his/her e-mail for days at a time, causing a slight [inconvenience] when they have to [read up] to several definitions in one sitting.
		Example: Frank: "Hey Tom, did you see today's Urban Word of the Day? [Funny stuff]!"
		
		Tom: "Oh don't get me started! I had to read like 10 of those today! I haven't [checked] my [e-mail] in over a week!"

	(2008-12-21 +11/-8)

	(2012-11-18 +62/-77)
	[Urban youth] are individuals who are into the hiphop-better known as "swag"-scene. They are often found in groups composed of only other [urbans]. They may even consider their friends their "crew" and make up some stupid name for it like "[taylor gang]", "get money boyz", or "the ranjers". These individuals often believe that their "swag" is their "key to success" and anyone who insults their swag or disagrees with their lifestyle is merely a "hater making them famous". They love to make up slang and they are infamous for using terms such as: "yaw ready know what it is", "[smfh]", "finna", "real talk", "bruh", and "nigguh" (pronounced niggyuhh). Appearance wise they tend to prefer [clown shoes] (Nike and Jordans, usually [high tops]), snapbacks, fitted hats, and they love black and white tattoos. When it comes to music hip hop and rap are their two favorites. Wiz Khalifa, Rick Ross, Lil Wayne, Drake, Tyga, etc. and they love to claim that they are into "underground". They often believe that they are "on some real chit" and encourage the hoodrat lifestyle. [Urbans] are not restricted to a certain location or ethnicity. Urbans come from all areas and they come in all shapes, sizes, and colors.
		Example: The urban youth went to [Foot Locker] to buy new pair of [Jordans] for [a Wiz Khalifa] concert later that night

	(2008-05-14 +13/-1)
	The act of having [looked up] a term on [UrbanDictionary.com], this term is a lot easier to use than having to say 'urbandicionaried' ... it just [flows] so much better.
		Example: [I just] [urbandicted] [the word] 'urbandicted'.

	(2008-05-08 +22/-4)
	The most clever, hilarious, legendary contributors to UrbanDictionary.com. [Urbandictators] are freakishly accurate with their definitions and they rate every definition they read. Urbandictators submit enormous amounts of definitions and by doing so they waste most of their life. Urbandictators should be honored for their sacrifice for the sake of our [street smarts] and [mocked] for being total nerds. 
		Example: Dude, this [Urbandictator's] definition of ['emo'] totally kicked [my definition's] ass.

	(2006-06-28 +944/-62)
	A place for you to [lie] about the amount of sexual [knowledge]/[experience] you have.
		Example: "Damn, that chick [rejected] me...what do I do now?
		
		...
		
		I know! I'll go on urbandictionary and give words fake sexual meanings!  [That'll] help my [self-esteem]!"

	(2006-06-30 +9148/-695)
	Supposed to me a user-inputed [dictionary] for words. However, has become a [mindless] [forum] of jokes, view-points, sex, and basically anything but the real definition of a word.
		Example: "I [typed in] the word 'shark' in UrbanDictionary."
		"What is it?"
		"Apparently a way to have sex."
		"[Hmph], I always thought it was a [sea creature]."

	(2004-12-08 +640/-45)
	A website founded on a great idea but saturated by people trying to make personal insults (to millions of people who [don't give a flying fuck] about your [vendetta] with someone we've never met), and to make sexual connotations like alaskan pipeline or [pipe line]
		Example: [Urban Dictionary] is a place where you can be as [stupid] or [vulgar] as you want.

	(2006-05-27 +610/-46)
	A [site] where people [go on] to [search] words, even if they know what they mean, just to see what it says.
		Example: I [went] on urbandictionary and searched urbandictionary even though I [obviously] [already] know what it means!

	(2006-06-11 +917/-89)
	 
	[Urbandictionary] is what you get
	when you cross [wikipedia]
	with [mental retardation].
	 
		Example: "The downside to [urbandictionary's] [inclusionist] approach and unexacting quality control is a low [signal to noise ratio] and – by Wikipedia standards – wall-to-wall vandalism."

	(2010-08-08 +263/-37)
	A good, original idea for a website until it was [hijacked] after [takeoff] by the majority of the teenage populaton and 45% of the adult population.
	
	Most of these people take forms as trolls, [flamers], ignorant retards, fanboys/fangirls, or people who just manage to piss everyone off with their definitions. Only a small minority of the definitions on this site are written by sane, logical, smart people.
	
	Sadly, many stupid, [ignorant people] had to [butcher] those definitons simply because they saw the definition got alot of thumbs ups.
	
	One major problem of the site is that because 75% of the definitions on Urbandictionary are written by sex addicted morons, 80% of the definitions are sexually related, turning a good movie, [GoldenEye], into some sex maneuver that simply doesn't even makes sense.
	
	People also turn this site into a place to let their anger out on respectable, good people. For example, one definition for the police was "
	An asshole who arrested innocent people for smoking weed". Well, if they were smoking weed, they wouldn't be innocent would they?
	
	Other people also feel the urge to criticize famous people on Urbandictionary simply because no one wants to listen to their ignorant gibberish in reality.
	
	Plus, half of the definitions on this site contain [typos], grammar mistakes, and typing that makes them look like they are texting a definition.
		Example: 11 year old troll:
		[fkin] lebron james [suks] donkey dik i could even take dat nigguh in a match
		
		Stupid Jealous Flamer:
		Bill Gates is a motherfucker cause he's filthy rich and doesn't care about other people.
		
		Horny teenager:
		[Goldeneye]: when u piss in ur [gf's] eye during sex
		*proceeds to crash his laptop due to tryin to watch porn*
		
		Angry criminal:
		Police: Power abusing assholes who took my crack cocaine and confiscated everything I had, they suck ass.
		Urbandictionary

	(2004-06-20 +1114/-205)
	[UrbanDictionary] is a site where you can look up [slang words]. The site itself is a good idea, too bad that half of the definitions were added by stupid and [hateful] people, and it can be quite depressing 'cuz if you want to remove something, you have to fill a whole damn questionnary and it takes more time than posting comments.
		Example: [no example]

		White guy: Oh.

	(2022-05-18 +18/-2)
	The perfect place to find [perverts] putting sexual [definitions] on [non-sexual] terms.
		Example: Searched up "[red baron]" on urbandictionary, and I [got weird] shit related to sex and girls' [periods]. I hate this place.

	(2007-12-31 +27/-4)
	1. A website where douchebags come to when they are bored and post completely useless definitions. Most of the definitions they post have to do with sex/sexual acts. Definitions for words like [blockhead], [dentist], and other words that have nothing to do with sex.
	
	2. Don't mistake these idiots with the people who post real definitions that actually help/[inform] people in some way.
		Example: Idiot: "[Heh heh heh] I know what [blockhead] means and it be naughty." >=D "Ima post it on urbandictionary."
		
		Normal Person: "...[People like you] are a waste of our precious, precious oxygen."

	(2004-03-02 +402/-116)
	A place for [oh so] "[clever]" kids to create breathtakingly unhumorous definitions for various words, both real and [contrived].
		Example: [Poopchute spork thinger] - OMG!  It's what you use to eat out [your dog's] ass after he's had worms!!!! [OMGWTF]!!11 FUnnnYYYyY!!!111

UrbanDictionary Nerd
	(2010-02-05 +67/-21)
	One who spends large [portions] of his or her time on the site Urban Dictionary [aimlessly] typing in letters to see what weird definitions others have written.
	In addition, this group of people occasionally write their own definitions in an attempt to be funny.
	
	But worst of all, UrbanDictionary Nerds are simply filthy [hypocrites].
		Example: If [you are] [reading] this, you're [probably] an UrbanDictionary Nerd.

_____

Urbandictionary User Basher
	(2004-05-27 +79/-30)
	Someone who posts crappy words on [urbandiction].com in order to insult another person. 
	[Fills] urbandiction.com with crappy words no one ever uses and will just be [deleted]
		Example: "[Man] [that guy] is [such a] Urbandictionary User Basher"

_____

UrbanDictionary's SHARE THIS
	(2010-11-23 +76/-4)
	The worst implementation of a SHARE feature.
	It can be found under every single definition for the word BUT it only shares the top definition!!
	Obviously if there are [multiple definitions] in a close race for the top [spot you] may like one of the other definitions but no matter which SHARE THIS link you [click it] shares the 'winning' definition.
		Example: UrbanDictionary's SHARE THIS [option] is [the Epic] Fail of [Social Networking] Sharing known to mankind!

_____

urbandictionary that
	(2005-05-15 +55/-10)
	Something you have to do when it is [impossible] to [check] what person has said in a "normal" [dictionary].

urbandictionary.com girls
	(2005-10-17 +93/-16)
	The models used on the urbandictionary.com website to advertise the shirts they have to offer. All models appear to be SE asian, not oriental. Are they the [webmasters]? The [webmaster's] friends or what? I tried to [get this published] before but it was shot down the fisrt day. Oh, this begs further investigation. 
	
		Example: Oh. I look at [urbandictionary.com] everyday and its true the same three or four urbandictionary.com girls [show up] [every day]. ARE THEY the webbmasters I wonder?

_____

urbandictionary.com
	(2009-07-14 +389/-40)
	[Proof] that [ANYTHING] can have [sexual] connotations!
		Example: I went on urbandictionary.com. [I will] never look at [banana pancakes], toothbrushes, or [clouds] the same way again.

	(2006-08-12 +2024/-366)
	One of the poorest compilations of knowledge available on the internet, thanks to a very relaxed [quality control]. Basically, there are five types of definitions you will find on anything:
	
	1) The informative, deceptively neutral definition that tells you what you wanted to know.
	
	2) The extremely biased definition that hints at a possibly psychotic author.
	
	3) The entry that only points you to the definition of an [obscenity] as reference, in an attempt to [be clever].
	
	4) The definition that only makes sense to the author's friends.
	
	5) The entry that details some weird sexual act, which probably has nothing to do with the word it's defining.
		Example: Some definitions of "George Bush" you might find on urbandictionary.com:
		
		Def 1: The 43rd president of the United States, was inaugurated on [January 20], 2001, went on to blah blah blah...
		
		Def 2: The worst fucking leader in the history of mankind, has the intelligence of [the pretzel] he choked on that one time.
		
		Def 3: See "Asswipe," "Chimpanzee," "Dickhead"
		
		Def 4: What Mike sounded like that one time at [Six Flags]! You know what I'm talking about, dude!
		
		Def 5: When your girlfriend accidentally bites off your cock and chokes to death on it.

	(2003-05-15 +839/-241)
	An internet site originally [conceived] as an open reference for urban [vernacular]. Instead, [trolls] use it as a forum for posting dumb opinions or making witty "definitions" for people they don't like.
		Example: urbandictionary.com is often [the scene] of silly [flame] [wars].

	(2003-08-29 +286/-93)
	A website, ostensibly created as a resource and a [snapshot] of the phenomenon known as "urban language". 
	
	A practically unmoderated, unsupervised word database, whose users can add their definitions of words they have used, or have made up without fear of identification.
	
	Of course, thanks to [human nature], no one uses it that way. Surprisingly, people are upset about this, despite its [inevitability].
	
	Which once again illustrates human nature.
		Example: 

	(2004-11-25 +485/-170)
	A [web site] intended to define both common and obscure english terms used as slang. In reality, however, it has become a haven of gay-bashing, Bush-bashing, and idiotic personal messages from [teenyboppers] and middle schoolers who believe this site should be their own [private message] board.
		Example: Definition of hot: OMG RYAN [THOMPSON] IS LIKE SOOOOOOOOOOO [HOT RYAN] IF YOUR READING THIS I LOVE YOUUUUUUUUU WILL YOU GO TO PROM WITH [MEEEEEEEE]???????????????

	(2004-08-20 +103/-45)
	A website where people go to [look up] [slang words]. Mostly used by middle-school-aged people to post random messages on, or [assholes] who subject everyone to their opinion.
		Example: urbandictionary.com is [cool] when [used] [properly]..

	(2010-11-08 +33/-12)
	Website where the majority of users appear to be white, liberal, [atheistic] males. Users define any word known to man with either a [biased] opinion, or [an inside joke].
		Example: The highest voted definition of the word "Religion" found on urbandictionary.com:
		
		"[The biggest lie] in human history. It has been responsible for more deaths throughout human history than all other unnatural causes combined. For a thousand years the Church was a [tyrannical] [dictatorship] that used religion to control the uneducated masses. Free your minds and come into the 21st century"
		
		-Obviously, this is a biased view, most likely coming from an atheist.

	(2007-03-27 +66/-29)
	hmm.. interesting, many people on this site are hypocrits. YOU think you can hide by saying racist comments, cmon seriously picking people to be editors is pretty foolish. i dont care if this isnt added. as long as someone reads it and is a reasonable person [im happy]. i just want the reader to know the effect it has on everyone.
	
	Ever tried searching your race?[Religon]?skin colour?language?your god? I have. you cannot find one of these pages without a single racist comment. How would you feel if someone was rude to you? Of course you would not like it. I am a muslim and have searched the words,"allah". "muslim". arab" everything you can think of. [I respect that] people are entitled to their opinion and have a right to speak, but this comes with responsibility; try searching those words and see the horrid, hurtful, [tearful], pathetic and annoying.

UrbanDictionarytard
	(2009-05-12 +252/-76)
	A person who "reinvents the wheel" by posting non-slang, Wikipedia-like (or [Dictionary.com]) definitions to Urban Dictionary.
	
	Urban Dictionary is more for slang, coined words, [ghetto slang] (ebonics), [teenspeak], regional colloquialisms and other neologisms that are defined for the benefit of others (preferably with some wit and humor).
		Example: Contrasting examples:
		
		[MISOGYNIST] (UrbanDictionarytard definition): A woman hater.
		
		MISOGYNIST (slang definition): A man who wins an argument with a feminist.
		
		>>>>>>>>
		
		RACIST (UrbanDictionarytard definition): Someone who feels racially superior, and exercises prejudice or negative attitudes towards people of a different skin color.
		
		RACIST (slang definition): A statement of surrender during an argument.
		
		When two people are engaged in an [acrimonious] debate, the one that first says "Racist!" has [conceded] defeat. Synonymous with saying "[Resign]" during a chess game.
		
		"Racist" acquired this [new meaning] when debaters (predictably) used the term as an argument of last resort. (They couldn't [prevail] against logic, truth, and common sense, so they played the race card to try and [eek] out a victory).
		
		>>>>>>>>
		
		CLOWN (UrbanDictionarytard definition): a circus performer known for their comic antics, exaggerated physical features, brightly colored costumes, and heavy use of stage make-up.
		
		CLOWN (slang definitions): 1. A person who is humorous without intention, therefore is a dumb mutha.
		
		2. A girl who covers herself in so much makeup, the true flesh of her face is difficult or impossible to see.

urbane dictionary
	(2007-02-02 +110/-13)
	If it existed, it some would say it to be the exact opposite of Urban Dictionary.  In reality, Urban Dictionary is just a [subset] of a truly [Urbane Dictionary], ideally [conceived].
		Example: One would perhaps not expect to find offensive slang, misspellings or incorrect grammar in the [Urbane Dictionary].  Urban Dictionary however?  [Par for the course], old boy.  The Oxford English Dictionary ([OED]) is quite urbane, though congnizant of urban slang.  A good, truly [urbane dictionary], however, would not seek to be prescriptive, it would faithfully report usage, both vulgar and sublime, without overt judgement or censorship.  Thus, the OED and Urban Dictionary truly need each other, in the grand scheme of things.

	(2005-11-10 +16/-8)
	A way for [bad] spellers to [enter] [this website].
		Example: [Yo man], I went to urbane dictionary and it [sent me] to [urbandictionary].

	(2006-09-17 +7953/-637)
	[A dictionary] that, every time I [read] it, my [faith in humanity] declines a little.
		Example: Urban Dictionary is [supposedly] for [defining] [your world].

	(2021-02-04 +232/-14)
	A website where every word is sexual shit but occasionally you can find slang terms that aren’t defined on google if you ain’t with [the times] and still use the word “[tubular]” like some [boomer].
		Example: “I [tried] to use Urban Dictionary for a generally nice [seeming] word and found some [real bad] shit...”

	(2009-12-31 +2473/-244)
	A site with an amazing concept that was great up until 2005-ish. Today, 90% of Urban Dictionary is clogged with bizarre sexual acts that have fucking nothing to do with the original definitions.
	
	The site in general is poorly [moderated] and misspelled to the bone. I often wonder if the creators of this site are still alive. I don't have much of a problem with incorrect spellings, but this shit heap has redefined (no pun intended) the word "misspell"
	
	Today, 10 year olds enjoy this place the most. The small amount of definitions on here that don't relate to sex, usually relates to race or stereotypes. The [0.01]% of the normal definitions are from back when this site was decent. [Grow the fuck up], people.
		Example: (5 years ago)[Urban dictionary user]: England- A country in Western Europe with a mixed population. Invented the blah blah blah...
		(Now) Urban dictionary user: a [englend] iz wen a gril wif croooked teet bites ur dick. dis becuz [peeple] in englennd hav bad teeth frm teh tee drinkin
		
		Goodbye Urban Dictionary, you were great while you lasted...

	(2017-01-13 +7430/-797)
	The Urban Dictionary is the website you are currently on. This website wastes a lot of your time. Like right now. You are reading this definition of The Urban Dictionary instead of doing something productive. So? Why are you still reading this? [Go outside] or something. [Shoo]!
	
	HA [GOT U]! THOUGHT THE DEFINITION WAS OVER! WRONG! Who goes outsidea anymore? I mean im outside as im typing this but who cares. Well, im in a car. Does that count as outside? Can u get [jailed] for driving someone elses car without permission?
		Example: "The Urban Dictionary is [a waste] of time." - [Some Random Guy] [Online]

	(2012-10-03 +573/-54)
	[The ultimate] [site] to [procrastinate] on.
		Example: [Andrew] was doing his homework, but then started [looking up] [definitions] on Urban Dictionary.

	(2020-09-15 +1337/-145)
	A great idea initially , but its quality has drastically deteriorated year after year and continues to get worse. It was founded in 1999 by [Aaron Peckham] while he was a freshman computer science major. Shortly afterwards it became abused by mostly teenagers/ dumbass children and to a [lesser degree mentally stunted adults] (largely due to the non-existent moderater position to look over words submitted). These individuals continue to flood its space with high levels of immaturity, retardation, first names of acquaintances with definitions that don't make sense to anyone, political bias, shitty grammar, nonsensical sexual innuendo stupidity and random words with definitions [pulled out of thin air] that are not used as slang by any living being in society . On occasion you can actually find a professional input of a real slang word that is legitimate and professional. RIP URBAN DICTIONARY. "You were good while you lasted."
		Example: Urban Dictionary is garbage. Everytime I go on [this website] a piece of my heart dies and I [shed] a [tear].

	(2015-10-16 +2831/-329)

urbaneering
	(2009-02-28 +164/-21)
	Playing in the outdoors in an urban setting - parks, [open space], trails, walking between art galleries, museums, and shops; dining [al fresco] - anything without a ceiling.  Just because you live in the city doesn't mean you have to be a [couch potato]!
		Example: [Chet] - "It's a [beautiful day] and we're here in town - let's go to some galleries and stuff!"
		
		[Kay] - "Yeah, let's do some intense urbaneering." 

	(2020-08-18 +12/-1)
	When your in class and [get bored] of searching up urban on [the urban dictionary] so you do the only logical thing you can do... [search it up] twice.
		Example: Me: there’s nothing good on [the urban dictionary] anymore.
		Friend: have [you tried] looking up urban?
		Me yeah I’ve [done that] many times.
		Friend: what about urban urban.
		Me: your a genius!

	(2017-04-22 +7935/-899)
	when ur too [lazy] to [type out] [urban dictionary]
		Example: I wonder how urban dictionary is defined in [the urban dictionary]. [hmmm]. "urban....[clicks enter]"

	(2015-10-27 +22/-1)
	A [suave] and [charming] person. Kind and [courteous].
		Example: [The man] was incredibly [urbane] and I enjoyed his [company].

	(2020-02-07 +464/-93)
	A mysterious word which is actually made up of the abbreviation “ur” and the word “[ban].” It probably hints to how the government is [planning] to ban Urban Dictionary because it speaks [the truth about] English and they’re jealous their dictionary can’t be the same.
		Example: I was [forced] to write something here containing the word [urban] to be able to post [this shit].

urbanethnic

	[Urbanites] are both a subculture and a contemporary lifestyle. They have 6 key characteristics: Time-poor, city-proud, media-literate, brand-centric, trend-sensitive and culturally-aware.
	
	The British newspaper Metro has listed the 10 "[Great expectations]" that above all else motivate and drive Urbanites:
	
	01. Expecting to live a meaningful and experience-rich urban life.

	03. Expecting to get substantial [fulfilment] from work (not just cash).
	04. Expecting to be at [the hub] of a large friendship network.

	08. Expecting to have a progressive government that delivers results.
	09. Expecting to live in a pleasant "[urban village]" area of their city.

		Example: I like him: He enjoys living in the city so much, his clothes are always nice, keeps up with [popular culture], is always organising events and going to [cool places] and is very [socially conscious] though he always complains he doesn't have enough time... He's a total urbanite!

	(2005-04-13 +52/-91)

	(2012-08-27 +92/-91)
	Without any racism intended, it is a failure... a failure in multiple areas of life (not just career). It is one who lets their pants sag. One who should evacuate the city at the earliest possible convenience to live a meaningful, fruitful and experience-rich life. One who emulates the mannerisms, language, and fashions associated with African-American culture, particularly hip hop in the United States or the Grime/Garage scene in Britain. A failed attempt at cultural appropriation. One who gets no fulfillment from work. One who is [the weakest link] in a friendship network, usually the "mooch" & one who is in debt or utilizes debt. One with no discipline, no true culture, no progress, no patience, [no responsibility], [no honor], [no dignity] & no respect. One who believes in the melting pot theory, that old blasphemous, gene-mutating perversion which permanently disfigures their offspring for ten generations. One who believes in immediate self gratification. One who is expecting the government to deliver food stamps and/or financial aid. A complete loser in ever sense of the word.
		Example: No, I will not move to [Philly]. It's filled with crime, drugs, allophillia & [urbanites]. We'll stay in [Hockessin] or we're threw.

		(Gets no reply; as there is no one around)

urinal anxiety
	(2005-02-21 +88/-10)
	An affliction of males characterized by unusual behaviours in the men's room.  [Urinal anxiety] is manifest in the actions of a man who walks into the men's room and heads directly toward [the urinals], but -upon seeing another man already standing at a nearby urinal- immediately changes course for the stalls.  Urinal anxiety afflicts a substantial number of males who have a phobia about pissing in a location where another male might notice their schlong (as if other males would have an interest in someone else's schlong...).  The most extreme form of [urinal anxiety] is usually seen in locations using the old "trough" urinals often placed in [ball park] restrooms.  The afflicted male approaches the other happy, piss-spattering companions, pulls his dick out, and... and... and... (after a long delay) [zips] his dick back up, unable to urinate, and shame-facedly departs the restroom unsatisfied.
		Example: Damn, Frank never uses [the urinals].  The other day he went into the women's room at the ball park to avoid [the trough].  I think he's [gripped] by urinal anxiety.

urinal protocol
	(2005-02-21 +61/-10)
	The unwritten, unmentioned male code of conduct strictly governing behaviour in a public restroom.
	
	[Urinal protocol] dicktates (pardon the pun) that every male must make due effort to accommodate a [buffer urinal] if possible.  In situations when a buffer urinal is not possible, the [pissor] must engage in mindless, inane, random conversation with his fellow piss-ees- a phenomenon known as [urinal talk].  The highest rule of [urinal protocol] governs eye contact.  Eyes must remain straight ahead in a zombie-like stare, and finish with only a brief glance downward (at your putz) during the final shake.  While a brief glance at the face of a fellow piss-ee is an acceptable part of urinal talk, a 30 second jaw-agape stare at his dong is un-cool.  Similarly, while placing a hand on the wall above the urinal to steady one's self  is acceptable (especially when drunk), placing one's hand on another's sholder is not too cool.  [Urinal talk] must never lead to the pissor urinating on the shoes of the piss-ee.
	
	Urinal protocol evolved as a means to deal with urinal anxiety (also referred to as being pee shy) and it's corresponding eccentric behaviour.  Restroom owners may erect (pardon the pun) a shame shield as a method of dealing with urinal anxiety and encourage compliance with the time-tested "urinal protocol".
		Example: Damn, Frank is such an idiot.  He was standing at [the trough] staring at [the black] [guy's] dick.

Therefore the overwhelming majority of Uruguayans are light skinned with light hair and blue eyes.  Uruguayans are also very warm, kind, friendly, and extremely hospitable.

	1.) A country of immigrants. Though some of the citizens like to forget that.

	Stands for United States of America.  Was initially a colonial territory of Great Britain before declaring [independance] in 1776.  Initially founded on the principle that a central government should only exist to provide security to its people and its borders without intruding on personal freedom and civil liberties.  Government was to be focused more on the individual states' powers rather than that of federal ones.  Certain [recent events] probably have the Founding Fathers turning over in their graves, as the great nation they created slowly degenerates into a [Police State]; something they feared greatly and took great measures to write the Constitution to prevent it.  Unfortunately, when the majority of the citizens, and the government, ignore the Constitution, it doesn't help much.
		Example: While America certainly is full of ignorant and/or rude assholes, there are still plenty of honest, good, [independant] thinkers.  Of course, many of us are planning to leave the country.  To all those that [bash] Americans, please remember that not all of us are awful and many of us think the same way you do - have [gripes] with our government, but not solely with us.

	(2010-11-28 +55/-24)

		Person2- Yes.
		Person1-But you're not fat, dumb, or [a slut]!
		Person2- You'd be [surprised] how many people aren't actually like that over there.

	The [security forces] career field is responsible for all police activities associated with an Air Force base. You could be doing anything from securing the perimeter of the base to being a dog handler. Your responsibility will be to ensure the safety of all base weapons, property and personnel from hostile forces. [Security forces] personnel learn lifesaving procedures; provide armed response; direct vehicle and pedestrian traffic on base; operate speed measuring, drug, alcohol and breath test devices; and conduct investigations. You will be involved in team patrol movements, tactical drills, battle procedures and military operations other than war. You might also be apprehending and detaining suspects, securing crime scenes or [testifying] in judicial proceedings. Security forces personnel also utilize military working dog teams, train handlers and all aspects of working dogs. Additionally, you might be assigned to an [armory] and be responsible for controlling and safeguarding arms, ammunition and equipment.
	
	[Security Forces] is in fact an extremely important job. They are the only line of defense between the air force base an the enemy. Now Security forces is [branching out] and doing even more work such as protecting convoys and even going on [off base] patrols.

The job itself usually entitles sitting around for long periods of time fighting to stay awake. There are the occasional retards who take extreme pride in these pathetic tasks. These faggots are called "high speed". If you are a woman in [security forces] you can get out of the suck by one of a few ways. One get knocked up, or two suck some serious dick. Either will land you a cushy [back office] job. Traits of SF members are heavy drinking and suicidal gestures. If you go in the air force open general you will most likely get SF as your job.

In the most basic terms, SF members are simply Federal Security Guards, with nothing more than a fauxe Army Combat Uniform to distinguish them from the run of [the mill] "[Mall Cop]". SF members are hated by the rest of the Air Force and not accepted by other military branches making them the most useless individuals in the military. As if that is not enough, SF members are known to treat eachother like crap and set eachother up for failure, ("Eat their own,...as the military describes it). There are a handful of SF units within the Air Force that actually contribute to the war fighting capability of the US. The individuals are an [exception to the rule] and should be respected for the hard work and sacrifices they make for a "thankless" job. If you are lucky enough to be one of these individuals, disregard this entry and understand this discription may apply to a majority of SF troops but is not an accurate description of everyone within the career field...hua!

Usagi Tsukino
	(2003-09-24 +77/-11)
	She is the Sailor Moon from [Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon]. Princess Serenity was a lady of grace and beauty. Her mother, Queen Serenity, raised her well to be the future queen of the Moon Kingdom. It was forbidden to have contact with the Prince of Earth, Endymion, but she fell in love with him helplessly. Now, in the present, the two are reunited in a fierce situation.
	
	When Luna, the Queen's old feline advisor, found the Princess, she mistook her for someone else. Not knowing she was right in front of her, she sent this girl out on a mission to find the lost Moon Princess. The girl she sensed power from was named Tsukino [Usagi]. Luna's mistake was not in vain; she transformed Usagi into the Pretty Sailor Suited Soldier, [Sailormoon]. The awesome Sailormoon defeated or healed all of her enemies.
	
	At first, Usagi couldn't very well handle being a super-heroine. Her cowardness didn't help her much in battle, but luckily, she had the mysterious Tuxedo Mask to save her. With practice, the unfit teenager turned into an all-powerful warrior. With the new challenges she faced almost every day, [Sailormoon's] powers increased.
	
	As a school girl, she didn't do well. Her grades were low, she fell asleep in class, and most every day, Usagi was late for school. Somehow, this clueless young lady survived and graduated to the next level of learning. In other words: high school. Being a [Sailor Senshi] certainly helped her there. With the coming adventures came the strength and confidence that she would need.

Useful Idiot
	(2011-10-29 +1686/-545)
	If you have never heard the term “[useful idiot]” it was the attitude held by [Vladimir Lenin] towards communist sympathizers in the West (America). While Lenin and the Soviets held them in utter contempt they also viewed them as tools for dispensing [communist propaganda] to other countries, thus infecting foreign cultures with their totalitarian tripe. After their mission was complete, they were no longer “useful.”
	
	It's a term the refers to brainwashed American marxists who blindly support any ideology that gets themselves out of real work and causes others to pay their way.
	
	it also refers to useful idiots who post inaccurate definitions of the term useful idiot on sites like the urban dictionary. while they believe that they are making some sort of statement, they are actually providing perfect examples of the term.
		Example: An American who espouses [Marxist] [ideals] is a [useful idiot].

	(2010-08-10 +1061/-680)
	Unthinking proponents of socialism and/or communism.
	You can usually find them swarming the internet, participating in riots to promote tolerance, attempting to think up questions for themselves to answer, or sitting in Starbucks with their friends discussing the failings of capitalism over a light frappuccino.
	
	[Useful idiots] are a conglomeration of [trendies], brainwashed Marxists, ex-hippies (now college professors), "quirky" wannabe-intellectuals, [migrant] street thugs, girlish B.A. students/uni-drones, and Michael Moore.
		Example: In 1952 Doris [Lessing], a British writer who has since won the [Nobel Prize] for Literature, was part of a delegation visiting the Soviet Union.
		
		Her memories of the trip are clear and [unforgiving]:
		
		“I was taken around and shown things as a 'useful idiot'... that's what my role was. I can't understand why I was so gullible.”
		
		--From the BBC, of all places.

	(2020-11-21 +24/-29)
	People who believe, act, and promote for a [higher power] who's interests are actually against that very person.
	
	That power sees that person as a "[useful idiot]." The powers-that-be exploit the [Useful Idiot] to carry out their own wants and needs. They often use the hate and fears of the useful idiot, to manipulate them into acting against their own [best interests].
		Example: That [tRumptard] redneck rube voted to give tax cuts to the rich plutocrats! It's cute how he pretends the rich create jobs. The rich see him as a [useful idiot]. And tRump thinks he's trash. But they know the useful idiot can be manipulated with hatred and fear to vote against their own [best interests].

	(2018-12-18 +27/-37)
	The person who likes to post ignorant [crap on this] [webpage] under the handle "[Herbertheperver]".
		Example: [Herbertheperver] is clearly a [useful idiot] who's [proned] to spinning a well-known term in an attempt to use it against the people who would use it as a term to define people just like Herbertheperver.

	(2016-08-08 +155/-276)
	A [useful idiot] is someone who unwittingly manipulated by [a foreign] government to help a foreign [government's] agenda, with the support of said foreign government. Being a foreign government's bitch.
		Example: Donald Trump is one of [Putin's] [useful idiots] because many of his ideas like not fully supporting NATO plays into Russia's agenda and would help Putin. Putin supports Trump by hacking his opponents' servers and broadcasting the democrats in a [negative light] and Trump in a positive light on his propaganda channel.
		
		Jill [Stein] is also one of Putin's useful idiots. She goes to Russia, a country notorious for its human rights abuses towards political opponents and gay people, and says the US needs to work on human rights and foreign policy. It's like going to Saudi Arabia and saying the US needs better women's rights. The night before she attended a dinner with Vladimir Putin, and she constantly retweets Putin's propaganda channel Russia Today.
		
		Both of these candidates are supported by the Russian Federation for nefarious reasons. Putin supports Trump because he thinks a Trump and a friendly US could make Russia stronger as a country, while the Russians support Jill Stein because she will take away votes from left-wing types who would normally vote Democratic, which could hurt Hillary and help Trump in close states.
		
		In other words, Donald Trump is [Vladimir Putin's] bitch.

	(2020-12-21 +16/-24)
	The kind of people who defined this term just like how the term was popularized in the first place: [propaganda].

	(2003-12-10 +2061/-1251)
	Term invented in Soviet Russia to describe people who blindly supported the likes of Lenin and Stalin while they committed atrocity after atrocity.
	
	Today, it refers to brainwashed liberals and leftists the world over (usually college students that aren't necessarily idiots, but just misinformed, naive, and ignorant of facts due to being indoctrinated with liberal/socialist propaganda through their public education) who believe that George W. Bush has committed more crimes against humanity than leftist darlings like [Saddam Hussain], [Yasser Arafat], and Osama Bin Laden, and still defend Communism, the cause of over 100 million deaths to this day.
	
	See also, [idiotarian]
		Example: Hundreds of [useful idiots] gathered at their college campus to burn American flags, pass out Communist pamphlets that apologize for Stalin and Mao, and to pledge support to their hero, [Saddam Hussain].
		
		[Useful idiots] need to be shown the facts, mainly that the United States and Israel are the greatest defenders of freedom and justice in the world. Until then, rational people can have fun laughing at their ignorance.

	(2012-11-25 +419/-284)
	Karl Marx described "[useful idiots]" as people who carry the Marxist ideals throughout a society or country itself, but this term can apply to anyone who believes in useless political ideals. Many young college students are bought and sold by liberal/socialist ideals like no-gun laws will stop crime in its tracks, heavy government control in our life is a good thing, and [universal healthcare] will solve all issues. They can be considered useful idiots because other countries around the world have proved these ideas horribly wrong, however they still blindly follow their leaders who say those things. [Useful idiots] believe they are fighting for "good" causes, but do not have the ability to think for themselves. If they would actually sit and think things out for a few minutes, they would realize how bad their ideas really are.
		Example: "My adherents are [useful idiots]." -Karl Marx
		
		Person 1: America needs [socialized medicine] because thousands of people can't get healthcare, and socialized medicine will solve that issue!
		
		Person 2: No it won't, the hospitals will just become so filled that LESS people will get help, and more people will die from curable diseases! Countries like Cuba and the U.K. have already proved this!
		
		Person 1: No, it works! You're just a [hatemonger] of the poor! It works in other countries and it will work here!
		
		Person 2: Ugh! What's the use of arguing this? You're just another useful idiot.

	(2016-07-31 +158/-146)
	Someone that follows orders without question and may [carry out] actions to help those that fed them the propaganda, such as disbelieves facts against whom they are [biased] toward, spreading [inaccurate] information in favor of their leader or unfavorably toward their opponent, and in general, act as a tool against their own self interest and the interests of those in whom they believe they know what's best for.
		Example: Sam believes he's fighting for freedom and liberation but he's bombing countries simply so that his government can take hold of the oil field and establish a central bank. Sam is a [useful idiot] for thinking freedom is the purpose, and those that support him as a troop are [useful idiots] for thinking their tax dollars don't kill innocent children in failed, illegal, [drone strikes].
		
		Rhonda is such a useful idiot because she thinks that Clinton matches her progressive ideals and chides those for supporting third party, yet, the two [party system] has been bombing countries for decades and making back door deals with large corporations. Most are tired of the corruption, yet Rhonda thinks that voting for those who are responsible for the corruption is somehow the best way to stop it. What a very useful idiot she is.
		
		Cletus loves Trump because Trump says he won't send jobs out of the country, yet Trump's own products are manufactured out of the country. Cletus does not think Trump is a lying hypocrite because Cletus is a useful idiot.

	(2004-01-03 +556/-779)

USMMA
	(2009-01-23 +109/-17)
	 [The United States Merchant Marine Academy] is one of five Federal Service Academies along with [USAFA], West Point, USCGA, and [USNA]. Its mission is:
	
	"To educate and graduate [Merchant Marine] Officers and leaders of Honor and Integrity who serve the maritime industry and armed forces and contribute to the economic, defense, and homeland security interests of the United States."
	
	 Graduates may enter into the maritime service or take a commission as an officer in any active or reserve armed service. Located in Kings Point, NY, the academy is highly regarded and well known for producing some of the nation's brightest and most successful military and business leaders. 
	
	 That being said, it is a great place to be from, but not a great place to be. It is notorious for being ranked as the school with the least happy students, and some of the worst food and dorms in the nation by Princeton review. See: [kappa pi sigma].   
	
	 The academy was dedicated on September 30th, 1943 as a result of the need for merchant mariners for the war efforts of WWII. On February 20th, 1956, it was permanently established as the fourth federal service academy.
	
	 USMMA is a four year college, and one of these years is spent at sea on real merchant ships and visit an average of 20 foreign ports. Every graduate will have 300+ days working on a merchant vessel, and will have either a 3rd Mate's of 3rd Assistant Engineer's license.
	
	 No matter what any of the other state maritime academies may say, USMMA is still the best. They are simply jealous that they got rejected from KP and have to pay for their education. Known also for breeding alcoholic womanizers and swearing sailors alike.
	 
	
	
		Example: "Hey man I heard you're going to USMMA! Congrats! How is it there?"
		
		"[Kappa Pi Sigma], man. The girls are ugly and the food sucks nutsack, but it won't matter when I [graduate] as a 3rd [Assistant] Engineer and start making fuckin' bank."

	United States [Merchant Marine] Academy
	
	Situated across from the ONE and ONLY best Maritime College in the nation, [SUNY Maritime], this college likes to boast that it is a federal service academy and that it's free, when in fact it is niether of those.
	
	In a recent televised special on U.S. Federal Service Academies, USMMA was not included (in fact, it was rejected for consideration) AND as of the mid-2000's one must pay a normal [college tuition] to attend.
	
	Contrary to what their graduates and staff say about their cadets' post-USMMA careers, they are hated in the working world, and several shipping companies actively maintain directives stating they will NOT hire their graduates because they possess poor attitudes and a sense of arrogance that pisses off everyone at even the highest levels of management.
		Example: USMMA kids think they are special cause they got "appointed" to [attend]. That just means the regular Maritime College cadets had to work half as hard as them to earn the same degree and [license] with [ten times] the respect at the end.

USS Jimmy Carter
	(2006-09-21 +54/-58)
	The USS Jimmy Carter is a [CNO] [Special Projects] Boat.  Originally destined to be the third in the vaunted Seawolf Class Nuclear Attack Submarine, she ended up being the last in the class, cut in half, extended by 100 feet, and sent to sea.  A problematic, overengineered design to begin with, the Navy in their infinate wisdom, decided to throw 100 feet of even more overengineered crap in the middle and call it good.  The Navy has been paying for that mistake (literally) ever since.  If the [logistical] problems of maintaining a 3 boat class weren't bad enough, compound that with a [laundry list] of [must-have] parts that aren't made any more, add a touch of [shipyard] (EB) "craftsmanship", and sprinkle in a generous amount of DFS'.  The phrase "SAT for sea" is commonly used, usually to describe the piece of duct tape being used to hold in that valve that penetrates [the hull], half-assed welded in place by a stoned metalworker who came in drunk with half a joint in his mouth.
	If that wasn't bad enough, listen to the crew:
	There have been people stuck [onboard] for 5+ years with no end in sight.
	In that time, some of them have never gone to a school.
	Most of them have had multiple award nominations shot down by the upper echelon.
	Almost all of those going up for terminal leave have had it denied, or told it was a "set-in-stone" date, only to have it cancelled after tuition and a house has been paid for back home.
	Some have been in their rotation window up to 3 times, but keep getting extended because it's difficult to find someone who hasn't heard of this floating [shitheap].
	Most boats lose 1-3 guys a year due to clearance, medical, legal, or psychological issues.  The goodship JC has lost 42 since 2003 massively due to psychological issues.  And nothing has been done, despite the many protests of the crew.  Good men have been lost to this ongoing problem, and the loss rate is increasing.
	It's not limited to the blueshirts, either.  Chiefs and officers have fallen before the incredible stresses needlessly placed on those aboard.
	Re-enlistment has been hovering just above 0% since the keel first touched water.  Nobody wonders why.
	Crew morale is so bad, those onboard look forward to injury so they can [get some rest].
	Crew morale is so bad that the COB had to make a ships picnic mandatory just to get some people to show up.  Many arrived in the parking lot, waved, then turned around and left.
	A [senior chief] with 17 years in refuses to [re-enlist] and finish his 3 years because it's not worth extending onboard another 6 months.
	All in all, the "leading indicators" show that this [boat is] a crap-heap with a list of receipts 10 years long.  The motto is "[Semper] Optima" meaning "Always the Best", but should be "Abandon Hope, All Ye Who Enter Here".
		Example: "I got my [orders], I'm going the the USS Jimmy Carter!"
		"Dude, haven't you heard, that [boat is] [a piece of crap]!"
		"But I heard that the..."
		"Dude, did this by any chance come with the phrase 'Have I got a deal for you?'"
		"Yeah, how'd you know"
		"Dumbass"

It has a rich history of not-so-stellar commanding officers, the 2 most recent ones being an [irascible] totalitarian and an [egoist] who thinks he's stellar.
	
	A faulty [CRP] [Propeller] System has caused it numerous delays, and is consequently the chief source of income for BAE ship repair yard.
	
	Although its demographics enjoy a fair share of diversity, every crew member is a closet-racist. There is a scarce number of Asian-Americans and is the one group who are most likely to be discriminated against.
	
	Fraternization is commonplace, and is a direct cause for a growing average number of pregnancies per year.
		Example: 3rd Class: "Where you gonna be stationed at bro?"
		[Sailor]: "The USS Vella Gulf!"
		
		"Ha! I just got off that shithole. Fuck that place!"
		"[Well I'm] pretty sure it won't be that bad..."

Utah Road Construction
	(2007-08-21 +78/-7)
	The biggest and longest running joke ever to be pulled by a state or nation in history.
	The joke is that some people get together somewhere and map out a place to set up cones and tear up the road. Setup then involves blocking off a half mile strip of [road on] either side of the [workzone], and proceeding to jackhammer the hell out of the asphalt.
	The punchline is everyone that has to drive through the workzone, as the workers not [jackhammering] (all of them) laugh at the frustrated looks on peoples faces as they go by, late for work by at least half an hour or more thanks to a four lane highway being shrunken to one lane.
	Once the "work" is supposed to be done, or when a new place is found, the workers [pull up stakes] and move, leaving the road the same as it was before they came, or worse.
	This has been going on since before recorded history in Utah, although no record has currently been found as to whether it started with the laying of asphalt in Utah, or merely when roads were established.

	This widely practiced method of settling disputes originated among [Adam Smith's] early followers as a [non-lethal] alternative to dueling. Recently, it has been employed as a [litmus test] to determine where a man falls in the spectrum of sexuality, as a heterosexual male would obviously not allow another man to force him to climax.
	
	These affairs are rarely witnessed as they occur behind closed doors due to the socially questionable nature of the practice, but are truly a spectacle to behold. There is typically an exorbitant amount of grunting, [grimacing], sweating, trying not to make out with each other, and occasionally crying, ending with an outburst from the losing contestant that consists of equal parts orgasmic pleasure and shame.
	
	It is rumored that Joseph Smith hurriedly invented the [Utah Standoff] to explain what was happening when someone walked in on him passionately and intensely jerking off one of his followers, but again, these are only rumors.
		Example: [Ezekial]: That is verily my sheep, for I recognize it as the most beautiful in the flock. Return it to me at once, [Jedidiah], or I shall invoke the Utah Standoff.
		
		Jedidiah: Bring it on.
		
		(Utah Standoff proceeds, Ezekial is defeated)

		Ezekial: I love you.
		
		Jedidiah: I love you too.
		
		Me: [That's pretty gay].

Utahism
	(2004-11-23 +53/-91)
	[Call me Ishmael]. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off [the spleen] and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it is a damp, [drizzly] November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my [hypos] get such an [upper hand] of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off- then, I account it [high time] to get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish [Cato] throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me.
	
	There now is your insular city of the [Manhattoes], belted round by [wharves] as Indian isles by coral reefs- commerce surrounds it with her surf. Right and left, the streets take you waterward. Its extreme downtown is the battery, where that noble mole is washed by waves, and cooled by breezes, which a few hours previous were out of sight of land. Look at the crowds of water-gazers there.
	
	Circumambulate the city of a dreamy Sabbath afternoon. Go from Corlears Hook to Coenties Slip, and from [thence], by [Whitehall], [northward]. What do you see?- Posted like silent sentinels all around the town, stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries. Some leaning against the spiles; some seated upon the pier-heads; some looking over the bulwarks of ships from China; some high [aloft] in the rigging, as if striving to get a still better [seaward] peep. But these are all landsmen; of week days pent up in [lath] and plaster- tied to counters, nailed to benches, clinched to desks. How then is this? Are the green fields gone? What do they here?
	
	But look! here come more crowds, pacing straight for the water, and seemingly bound for a dive. Strange! Nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land; loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice. No. They must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling And there they stand- miles of them- leagues. Inlanders all, they come from lanes and alleys, streets avenues- north, east, south, and west. Yet here they all unite. Tell me, does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them [thither]?
	
	Once more. Say you are in the country; in some high land of lakes. Take almost any path you please, and ten to one it carries you down in a dale, and leaves you there by a pool in the stream. There is magic in it. Let the most [absent-minded] of men be plunged in his deepest reveries- stand that man on his legs, set his feet a-going, and he will infallibly lead you to water, if water there be in all that region. Should you ever be athirst in the great American desert, try this experiment, if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor. Yes, as every one knows, meditation and water are wedded for ever.
	
	But here is an artist. He desires to paint you the dreamiest, shadiest, quietest, most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the [Saco]. What is the chief element he employs? There stand his trees, each with a hollow trunk, as if a hermit and a crucifix were within; and here sleeps his meadow, and there sleep his cattle; and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke. Deep into distant woodlands winds a [mazy] way, reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill-side blue. But though the picture lies thus tranced, and though this pine-tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this [shepherd's] head, yet all were vain, unless the shepherd's eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him. Go visit the Prairies in June, when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee-deep among Tiger-lilies- what is the one charm wanting?- [Water-] there is not a drop of water there! Were Niagara but a [cataract] of sand, would you travel your [thousand miles] to see it? Why did the poor poet of Tennessee, upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver, deliberate whether to buy him a coat, which he sadly needed, or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to [Rockaway Beach]? Why is almost every robust [healthy boy] with a robust healthy soul in him, at some time or other crazy to go to sea? Why upon your first [voyage] as a passenger, did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration, when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land? Why did the old Persians hold the sea holy? Why did the Greeks give it a separate deity, and own brother of [Jove]? Surely all this is not without meaning. And still deeper the meaning of that story of [Narcissus], who because he could not grasp the tormenting, mild image he saw in the fountain, plunged into it and was drowned. But that same image, we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans. It is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life; and this is the key to it all.
	
	Now, when I say that I am in the habit of going to sea whenever I begin to grow hazy about the eyes, and begin to be over conscious of my lungs, I do not mean to have it inferred that I ever go to sea as a passenger. For to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse, and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it. Besides, passengers get sea-sick- grow quarrelsome- don't sleep of nights- do not enjoy themselves much, as a general thing;- no, I never go as a passenger; nor, though I am something of a salt, do I ever go to sea as a Commodore, or a Captain, or a Cook. I abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them. For my part, I [abominate] all honorable respectable toils, trials, and tribulations of every kind whatsoever. It is quite as much as I can do to [take care of myself], without taking care of ships, barques, brigs, schooners, and what not. And as for going as cook,- though I confess there is considerable glory in that, a cook being a sort of officer on ship-board- yet, somehow, I never fancied broiling fowls;- though once [broiled], judiciously buttered, and judgmatically salted and peppered, there is no one who will speak more respectfully, not to say reverentially, of a broiled fowl than I will. It is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old Egyptians upon broiled [ibis] and roasted [river horse], that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids.
	
	No, when I go to sea, I go as a simple sailor, right before the mast, plumb down into the fore-castle, aloft there to the royal mast-head. True, they rather order me about some, and make me jump from spar to spar, like a grasshopper in a May meadow. And at first, this sort of thing is unpleasant enough. It touches one's sense of honor, particularly if you come of an old established family in the land, the Van Rensselaers, or Randolphs, or Hardicanutes. And more than all, if just previous to putting your hand into the tar-pot, you have been [lording] it as a country [schoolmaster], making the tallest boys stand in awe of you. The transition is a keen one, I assure you, from a schoolmaster to a sailor, and requires a strong decoction of Seneca and the Stoics to enable you to [grin and bear it]. But even this wears off in time.
	
	[What of it], if some old hunks of a sea-captain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks? What does that [indignity] amount to, weighed, I mean, in the scales of the New Testament? Do you think the [archangel Gabriel] thinks anything the less of me, because I promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance? Who ain't a slave? Tell me that. Well, then, however the old sea-captains may order me about- however they may thump and punch me about, I have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right; that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same way- either in a physical or metaphysical point of view, that is; and so the [universal thump] is passed round, and all hands should rub each other's shoulder-blades, and be content.
	
	Again, I always go to sea as a sailor, because they make a point of paying me for my trouble, whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that I ever heard of. On the contrary, passengers themselves must pay. And there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid. The act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two [orchard thieves] entailed upon us. But being paid,- what will compare with it? The [urbane] activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous, considering that we so [earnestly] believe money to be the root of all earthly ills, and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven. Ah! how cheerfully we [consign] ourselves to [perdition]!
	
	Finally, I always go to sea as a sailor, because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the fore-castle deck. For as in this world, head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern (that is, if you never violate [the Pythagorean] maxim), so for the most part the Commodore on the quarter-deck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the [forecastle]. He thinks he breathes it first; but not so. In much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things, at the same time that the leaders little suspect it. But [wherefore] it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as [a merchant] sailor, I should now take it into my head to go on a [whaling] voyage; this the invisible police officer of [the Fates], who has the constant surveillance of me, and secretly dogs me, and influences me in some unaccountable way- he can better answer than any one else. And, [doubtless], my going on this whaling voyage, formed part of the grand programme of Providence that was drawn up a long time ago. It came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances. I take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this:
	
	"Grand Contested Election for the Presidency of the United States.
	"[WHALING] [VOYAGE] BY ONE ISHMAEL."
	"[BLOODY BATTLE] IN AFFGHANISTAN."
	
	Though I cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers, the Fates, [put me down] for this shabby part of a whaling voyage, when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies, and short and easy parts in [genteel] comedies, and jolly parts in farces- though I cannot tell why this was exactly; yet, now that I recall all the circumstances, I think I can see a little into [the springs] and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises, induced me to set about performing the part I did, besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment.
	
	Chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of [the great whale] himself. Such a [portentous] and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity. Then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk; the undeliverable, nameless perils of the whale; these, with all the attending marvels of a thousand [Patagonian] [sights and sounds], helped to sway me to my wish. With other men, perhaps, such things would not have been inducements; but as for me, I am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote. I love to sail forbidden seas, and land on [barbarous] coasts. Not ignoring what is good, I am quick to perceive a horror, and could still be social with it- would they let me- since it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in.
	
	By reason of these things, then, the whaling voyage was welcome; the great flood-gates of the wonder-world swung open, and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose, [two and two] there floated into my inmost soul, endless processions of the whale, and, mid most of them all, one grand hooded phantom, like a snow hill in the air.

The International Bureau of Weights and Measures makes use of data from the timing laboratories to provide the international standard UTC which is accurate to approximately a nanosecond (billionth of a second) per day.

His tan is impeccable and better than probably anyone else’s. Uula’s hair is so wonderfully blonde and brilliant that it is sometimes hard to think that such a unique and bright color is in fact, natural. Moving right along, Uula is not only incredibly gifted in the visual department, he also has talent in a variety of [extracurricular activities]. He is an avid [water polo] player and the school team thrived with his presence. He also was enrolled in a percussions course. This actually proved to be detrimental to some of the girls in the class because the only thing they did was watch Uula out of the corner of their eyes to catch a glimpse of his coveted stomach as he stretched. Uula is pretty much perfect in every way. His accent is the cutest thing you’ve ever heard. Perhaps Uula’s most enticing trait is the mystery that surrounds him. One glimpse of him and you will become absolutely obsessed.

UVM
	(2006-01-02 +301/-136)
	UVM: The University of Vermont is a place where out-of-staters (mostly from Massachusetts or Long Island) come and morph into what they think a  "[Vermonter]" is. This means they wear patchwork clothing, get dread-locks, and take on a new way of talking: slow and sounding [perpetually stoned] using phrases such as "yeah man". The true Vermonters look at the out-of-staters attempts at being "Vermonters" and wonder where the hell these people came from. 
	
	The student body is not made up of "hippies" rather, it is made up of 
	"[trustafarians]" (see definition). However, there is still the assortment of jocks, frat boys, sorority girls, and people who look like they play Dungeons and Dragons and are not ashamed of it. There is a slight lack of cultural diversity at the University of Vermont. 
	
	Overall UVM is a melting pot of people and is not just made up of pot-smoking trustafarians. 
		Example: Person A: Oh, so you go to UVM, that means you like [Phish] and want to save the earth and all that right?
		
		UVM student: Definitely, Phish is the most amazing band. Saving the planet is of [the utmost] importance. Hey man, do you [need a ride]? My Suburban is parked over there.

Oh, and one of the best men's hockey teams in the country to boot.

	Overly hyped with not much to back it up, there are better schools than this one; unless of course you are looking to develop a alcoholism. Then you are in the right place.
	
	The campus is poorly [laid out], with building scattered all over downtown Madison. The class sizes are ridiculous, and forget about having professors that actually give a damn. Madison itself is a very pretentious city. Filled with "[arty]" [wannabe's] and liberals. Really Madison, let's get over our fascination with State Street- which is just a bunch of overpriced stores and overpriced "ethnic" restaurants; and let's not forget [the endless] number of homeless people that line the streets.

Uwe Boll
	(2010-06-19 +67/-13)
	[a German] film [director] so bad (namely for his video game adaptions) that he makes the other bad film directors look like [Oscar] contenders
		Example: [Uwe Boll's] [video game] movies are [so bad] that they're funny

	(2006-03-24 +407/-115)
	A German film director best known for movie adaptations of video games, such as [House of the Dead], Alone in the Dark, and Bloodrayne.
	
	The quality of his films has often caused him to be referred to as a latter-day Ed Wood.  This is inaccurate; Wood was enthusiastic but inept, an earnest director whose vision as an artist greatly outstripped his meager abilities as a filmmaker.  [Boll's] films are driven by cynical exploitation of German tax law that allows a movie to make money even when it fails at the box office.  He is better thought of as a real-life Max Bialystock from The Producers, a movie in which a Broadway producer attempts to make money by intentionally staging a massive flop, [Springtime for Hitler].
	
	Rumors have said that the German government will be closing the tax loophole exploited by Boll.  If true, this will almost certainly end Boll's career as a director, as his movies are universally reviled by critics and shunned by audiences.
		Example: I thought about going to see the latest Uwe Boll movie, but decided to [stay home] and spend an evening driving [carpet] [tacks] into my scrotum instead.

	(2006-09-21 +278/-86)
	[the worst] [director] [ever]
		Example: [Movies] which were directed by Uwe Boll are just [unbelievable] [shit]!!!

	(2005-01-11 +509/-185)
	1. German film director, akin to a modern [Ed Wood], who primarily films very bad video game to movie adaptions such as [House of the Dead].
	2. Something or someone that is extremely bad, [untalented], or stupid.
		Example: "Uwe Boll is [surely] the worst [director] since [Ed Wood]"
		"Man, that shot was Uwe Boll"
		"God I'm sucking at this game today, I'm playing like Uwe Boll"

	(2007-04-16 +235/-134)
	An absolute joke to the movie industry and the worst director in the history of mankind.  He couldn't make a good movie if his pathetic life depended on it.  This asshole makes [Michael Bay] look like fucking [Steven Spielberg].  People compare him to [Ed Wood].  Well, that's an insult to Ed Wood.  At least Ed Wood loved movie making and was enthuastic that was [shadowed] by his poor filmmaking skills.  All Uwe Boll cares about is his publicity and he will sink to extremely low levels to do so.  One of his most famous stunts was challenging critics to boxing matches.  Well, once he found out who he was facing, he backed down like the pussy against everyone who was bigger and stronger than him.  Then he finally decides to beat the shit out of some wimpy critic who has absolutely no boxing training.  What a fucking pansy.
	
	In his latest attempt at controversy he sinks to an even lower level.  He decides to make [a 9/11] parody based on a [shitty game] called Postal.  It's pretty pathetic if you want to exploit a terrible terrorist attack to get your name in the paper.  Now liberal fucktards are creaming their pants everywhere thanks to him.  
	
	Where the fuck does he get his money to fund his films and WHY THE FUCK DO PEOPLE DECIDE TO WORK WITH HIM?!
		Example: I'd rather drink [diarrhea] [vomited] out of a [buffalo's] anus than watch an Uwe Boll movie.

	(2008-07-16 +48/-169)
	A German director, producer and [screenwriter] who is often said to be the worst director ever. That couldn't be further from true, [Uwe] is actually quite good, at least better than mainstream assholes like [Friedberg] and [Seltzer]. Most of the people who bash him do it because that's "cool" and have never even seen any of his movies. Or they bitch about how he ruined all those awesome games by converting them to crappy movies. But actually his movies are better than the games they come from, by watching the movies at least you can laugh at them, because they are not to be taken too seriously. After all, they are financed by [Nazi gold]. 
	
	Uwe is also upright, he knows that his movies are not successful and he makes jokes about them, unlike many directors who think they were chosen by God or something to make movies which actually suck ass.
	
	And the last time I checked bashers made that stupid petition to stop him, but it didn't work. So much about them. And we knows what he does to the critics in the [boxing ring].
		Example: guy1:OMFG [Uwe] Boll sucks ass dude!
		guy2: Did you see any of his movies?
		guy1:like...no. But he totally sucks lol
		guy2: stfu please [dumb fuck]
		
		guy1: oh no Uwe made another game to movie [adaptation]! They are total shit!
		guy2: Did you actually play any of these games before watching the movies?
		guy1: ...No. But they still like totally suck and stuff. Everybody says so.
		guy2:...

	(2015-09-21 +45/-5)
	Often the only and/or [the last resort] as an option for higher education among Caribbean students. While some Faculties have been updated/ upgraded throughout the years, others have remained basically the same since many Caribbean nations were still colonies. Rude/ [unhelpful] administrators ensures customer service is always bad, lack of funding means that the University is seemingly always on the verge of banruptcy, and trying to eek out as money much from students. That wouldn't be so bad, if there were decent facilities- but good luck finding a textbook or research paper written within the last 5 yearsfrom the library, and you should always expect something to not work at some time or the other. There are some very good lecturers here, but UWI also hosts the literal worst, who fail so spectacularly at saying something remotely [comprehensible] in the span of 1-2 hours .

	Uzi machine pistol
	
	Contrary to popular belief, it is unlikely that so called "Gangstas" would typically posses such a weapon.

	Weapons commonly mislabelled as "uzis" include
	Scorpion [vz] 61 machine pistol

Nearly all Uzis are 9mm parabellum, but conversion kits are available for other calibers as well.

	The Uzi is a selective-fire, open-bolt, submachinegun manufactured by [IMI] of Israel.  It is large, extremely heavy, and notoriously inaccurate on [full auto] -- however, it is also extremely reliable, easy to strip down, and has a slow [cyclic] rate (approx 650 rpm), making it ideal for the non-combatants to whom it is currently issued (clerks, school teachers, rabbis, private citizens of Israel).  It is considered obsolete for military or law enforcement purposes.  Many journalists and gangstas confuse the Uzi with inferior weapons, such as the [TEC-9] or [MAC-10] pistol -- which typically are not even fully automatic.  Nearly all Uzis are 9mm parabellum, but conversion kits are available for other calibers as well.
		Example: [Public Enemy] had a rap song back in the 80s titled, "My [Uzi] weighs a ton" -- [fully loaded], an Uzi weights about 15 pounds.
