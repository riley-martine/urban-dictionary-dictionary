X-Japan
	(2004-07-19 +292/-68)

	[X-Japan] started out as a band called Noise. At the age of only twelve the leader of the band [Yoshiki] [Hayashi] and the vocalist and co-founder of the band Toshimitsu Deyama decided to form a band. Yoshiki being the great musician he is had begun to write lyrics and probably music at an even younger age. After his father commited suicide at age 33 Yoshiki wrote the song "Tears" for his father at the age of only ten. The song went on to become one of X-Japan greatest and most famous [ballads].
	
	In 1985 the band's name was changed to X. The first firm lineup of the band developed. The members at the time were [Toshi] on vocals, [Pata] and hide on guitar, [Taiji] on bass and Yoshiki on drums and piano. In 1985 the band released their first single "I'll Kill You" on Dada Records. X was known for [visual kei] (a music genre that involves feminine looks and obscure music) which was not praised during that time. Yoshiki founded his own record label [EXTASY] RECORDS in 1985 to ensure production for X (he gets even more amazing doesn't he?).
	
	In 1988 the band's first album "Vanishing Vision" was released. This album brought into play some of the most [recalled] heavier songs for the band.

The early styling was really aggressive, and its probably safe to say its THE best looking SUV on the road. The interior is filled with every [amenity] one could want (my 02 [3.0] has satnav, bluetooth, roof, cold weather, and some other sick options) and is really luxuriously sporty. The steering is spot on and the handling behaves like a 5, [niiice]. The [bimmer] [straight 6] is a work of wondrously brilliant engineers and puts some pointless [redlining] fun into doing things like pulling out of target, merging, etc. DON'T bother with the X3 as you will be missing out in what its big brother has to offer. The X5 is a beautifully crafted work of pure german automotive genius.
		Example: Uneducated cock: The X5 is a slow, heavy, non-responsive waste of an auto. They should've stuck to making cars.
		
		Me: Well you can go kill yourself you [ignorant fool] as the X5 is none such things. The truck is a work of automotive art, like a Maserati [Ghibli], or Ferrari [288 GTO].

Xaldin
	(2007-04-22 +51/-2)
	Organization [XII] member, number III. Xaldin is also known as the "[Whirlwind Lancer]", and controls Dragoon Nobodies. He uses six lances, and has the element of Wind.
	
	Xaldin first appears in Hallow Bastion ([Kingdom Hearts II]), tempting Beast to use the darkness. Later, he fights Sora after a failed attempt to kidnap Belle and Beasts' rose. The key to defeating him is the use of the Learn reaction command, which does massive damage. Many players found this boss fight difficult because of the few chances to block his many attacks.
		Example: Xaldin 's Somebody is [Dilan], one of the original assistants of [the real] [Ansem].

	(2007-12-12 +76/-7)
	How often is it that people take Xaldin and give him a personality that seems less intelligent than what he really is? He is truly a brilliant man, as his time as one of the Apprentices would indicate, and it is [doubtful] that he has quite the penchant for stabbing and drinking that so many seem to think he has. True, one doesn't learn terribly much of him from the game, but he does prove that he can think and plan things out quite well, even [under pressure]. And yet instead of [basing] his personality off of what he does and says, so many people seem to enjoy basing it off of their interpretation of his appearance. Yes, just before the battle against him begins, he asks, "Where's the fun in this?" but couldn't he be asking it out of boredom from the belief that fighting is less interesting to him than taking the time to learn about someone and attempt to manipulate them.
	
	It‚Äôs true that that's not overly positive either, but it‚Äôs likely that Xaldin is far more [restrained] than most people seem to consider him. He hides his thoughts from the world, keeping them to himself with a strict [discipline], similar to that of [Sa√Øx]. Along the same line of thought, consider how much [work it] would take to control six lances so [finely] all at the same time. Wouldn't that itself require a great deal of concentration? And so Xaldin, becomes an incredibly deep character, where nothing outside of his discipline and intelligence are recognized for sure.
	
	To some, Xaldin seems to be a sad character, with a deep pain kept inside, where no one can see it. The scars from things he has done, the ways he learned things, and even the things that were done to him that he didn‚Äôt deserve are all locked away in the dark, hidden behind a wall of perpetual loneliness and [distrust]. And those are, in turn, [veiled] by his immense discipline. This control allows him to do things such as the actions shown in the game. Yes, Xaldin [grinned] as he [abducted] [Belle], but she was simply part of his plan, a [continuation] of how he was [rousing] the Beast‚Äôs [ire]. After what was likely a very cold and [unforgiving] past, perhaps that malicious grin of his is the only way he can express himself to those he cannot trust.
	
	Despite his immense strength and discipline, the [Lancer] also seems as though he has his moments of weakness, often when no one else is there to witness them. He quite possibly goes out during the night and gazes at the moon, thinking, remembering, and comparing. He might occasionally have nightmares, [visions] of a traumatic past that he‚Äôd rather forget. The distrust that he would have developed keeps him from telling even those he manages to grow close to the whole truth and cause him to keep the terrible pain to himself, not out of concern for the others but to keep them from leaving. Behind his brilliance, hidden beneath so many protective layers, is likely really just a simple child, trying to find someone that will stay with him, no matter his flaws but with the misbelief that he must hide the darkest parts of himself and what he‚Äôs been through.
	
	Regretfully, this is merely an [overview] of a more thoughtful way of looking at Xaldin‚Äôs character, of attempting to see the man hidden behind the fierce appearance.
		Example: Xaldin is one of the most [misunderstood] and [misrepresented] members of [Organization XIII].

Xan
	(2015-07-22 +406/-48)
	A slang term (pronounced "[zan]") that refers to the often abused perscription drug Xanax ([alprazolam]). This shortened version of the name is used almost exclusively by those involved with the drug recreationally. On Anerican black markets, one will hear the terms "[xan]" or "bars" more often than "xanax" or "alprazolam." The origin of this abbreviation is unknown, but it likely came about due to the fact that one who is acutely intoxicated on xanax might be incapable of pronouncing the longer names.
		Example: [OFFICER]: "License and [registration] please..."
		
		SOME GUY: "Uh......a...re.......eg..."
		
		OFFICER: "Sir, are you okay?"

		"[Oh hey], [I love that] song!"

	(2007-12-07 +88/-28)
	1. lengthy prog rock/hard rock tune by the Canadian band Rush. I think it refers to a classic piece of lit called "[Kubla Khan]", don't quote me on this.
	
	2. one of the most wretchedly godawful movies ever made. An absolute waste of time, film, money and effort. It was a total dud and a bomb during the summer of 1980. The story line was unbelievably stupid. It was possibly the worst movie ever released to public cinemas until that exalted status was taken by "Sibling Rivalry" ten years later. It starred the Aussie [Olivia Newton-John] as a "muse", can [U dig] it? But it gets worse from there, much worse. About the best thing about this flick is the historical fact that the action that occured during the music clips foretold the emergence of MTV the following year. The soundtrack ain't too bad, however. Olivia scored a big hit with "Magic", another one with "Suddenly" (with Cliff Richard), and the title track with the "[Electric Light Orchestra]". ELO also scored high with their own "I'm Alive" and "All Over the World". Despite the embarrassment that this shitty movie placed upon them, ELO and Olivia would go on further into their music careers with even more success. 
		Example: 1. When I saw Rush on their "30th Anniversary Tour" in 2004 they played a wide spectrum of classics, including "Xanadu".
		
		2. I first saw Xanadu on TV at my grandparents' house one summer a few years after that movie first came out. A complete piece of trash. Olivia herself would later star in another flick, "[Two of a Kind]", with [John Travolta] again. It too was an utter pile of puke. My roomate commented on [Olivia's] nice ass. That was the best thing you could say about that one.

Together, they create great art: a [roller disco] named Xanadu. The OBC stars Cheyenne Jackson, [Kerry Butler], Jackie Hoffman, Mary Testa, and Tony Roberts, to name a few.

xanax
	(2015-05-10 +512/-93)
	Xanax is mainly used for anxiety. Almost like a dirty word when brought up around a doctor. I don't quite get the hype of why [everyone loves it] and become insanely addicted to it. Just makes me really tired. Very easily obtained by and old aged doctor. My doctor is 72 and write 100 2mgs of xanax a month to me, and I didn't even [ask for it]. And all I said was that [I'm a bitch] when I get my period.
		Example: Go to a doctor younger than 55 for xanax, crying and complaining of severe [panic attacks] to the point of quitting your job and locking yourself in your room for months at a time and I promise you'll walk out with [some bullshit] like [gabapentin].

	(2004-10-30 +2916/-1711)
	Mild [benzodiazepine] ([Alprazolam]). Tablets are available from 0.25 to 2 milligrams in strength. Assists with anxiety and sleeping disorders.
	Due to its short half-life (3 hours) it is one of the more addictive [benzos]. Addicts can consume up to 14 mg per day. Withdrawal effects include psychosis and  epileptic-type seizures.
		Example: She spends so much time doctor-shopping for [Xanax],[she can't] [hold down] a job any longer!

	(2011-01-30 +389/-217)

	i've had a history of panic attacks since childhood, and this drug allows me to function at a high level - and basically do things normal people can do. without it i was a social [recluse] and could barely leave the house.
	
	i'm an alcoholic (sober) and you cannot compare .25 milligrams of this [to whiskey]. whiskey made me insane, this simple allows me to live and function.
	
	additive - yes! stop under a doctor's care.
		Example: the drug xanax is a huge part of [pop culture], largely because it's misunderstood and [abused] in outrageous [doses].

	(2006-01-05 +1615/-982)
	A very potent [benzodiazepine]. Often referred to as a "minor" [tranquilizer] , it is really anything but. Typically prescribed for anxiety and [panic disorder]. Dependence ensues quickly even at therapeutic doses , resulting in what is considered to be one of the worst withdrawal syndromes by the medical community when abruptly discontinued.
	
	The relatively low dose , when compared to the other benzodiazepines , is actually quite deceptive. The general concensus on therapeutic doseage equivalency among benzodiazepines is as follows:
	
	.5mg xanax
	1 mg [Ativan]
	.5 mg klonopin
	10 mg [diazepam] , Valium
	25 mg. Librium , Chlordiazepoxide
	
	As you can see , 2mgs of xanax is really not a small dose at all. It is equal to 4 10mg valium! Despite the fact that most doctors would never prescribe that much Valium , patients are far too often put on corresponding doses of xanax , and unknowingly become extremely dependent on the drug.
	
	The benzodiazepines are habit forming. W/D can be quite serious ,is of the alcohol type , and can lead to seizures and death if not managed medically. 
		Example: She didnt know she was [dependent] on xanax until she stopped [taking it] , and woke up in the [emergency room].

	(2003-12-11 +2228/-1518)

	(2007-12-11 +583/-478)
	A drug typically recommended or prescribed by [therapists] to treat anxiety issues. It's probably over prescribed and the professionals who do prescribe it seem to believe it's pretty harmless and about as addictive as alcohol; sometimes referred to as a wonderdrug with effects similar to valium but without the repercussions. Of course, these professional opinions are questionable as many medical professionals are in the pockets of large drug companies and [it's hard to say] which drugs, 20 years down the road, will be determined to be very harmful.
	
	Furthermore, there seem to be plenty of addiction/overdose horror stories regarding the drug. But, judging from personal experience, if you don't have an [addictive personality] (particularly with drugs), you probably won't think Xanax is anything special (I hardly notice the effects aside from occasional [sleepiness], will take it rarely, and won't have any problems. With the high number of commonplace issues for which this drug is prescribed (stress, anxiety, menstrual issues and sleeping problems to name a few), this drug is pretty easy to attain through a  doctor and more people than you might think have a prescription. This drug is basically as benign or as dangerous as the person who uses it.
		Example: "I thought I felt different the first time I took a [Xanax], but  to be honest I can't really tell [what it does]... sometimes it makes me [sleepy] though."

	(2008-10-23 +751/-636)
	often referred to as "[god's gift]". basically, god got bored one day and decided to [hook] humans up with [heaven on earth]. i'm pretty positive that's how we got xanax.
		Example: "you know, i didn't USED to care about [going to church], but i might reconsider... god really hooked us up with that xanax."
		
		"bro, semester abroad was insane... i just walked around the whole time looking at cathedrals, [twerped] up on [xans] and listening to hella."

	(2005-12-09 +254/-270)
	If you take them like your suppose to (like have anxiety and a [perscription]) then you won't become "addicted". Xanax is a [benzo] used to treat anxiety and [panic disorder]. It's mild (which is meant to describe the time it last). 
		Example: xanax comes in 4 [forms]
		.25mg white

	Most people take half to four of these at a time with alcohol.  It tremendously increases the effects of alcohol, and most people have a huge amount of [memory loss] the next after taking it. They are not able to remember much of what happened or what they did the night before.

If you find this rare and amazing creature keep it because there isn't ever going to be another like him. He can be really stubborn and will stand his ground in an argument (unless it's [that special someone]). He is really tall and has the most beautiful blue eyes. Xander is very ambitious with his goals for the future so he works very hard to get there. He thinks having a crush is what love feels like, until he meets that one who makes him really fall in love. When Xander is in love, [best believe] he will shower you with love and gifts and hugs as often as he can. He needs to be consistently reminded that he is enough, that he is loved, to be himself, and to tear that wall down.

	3) In your status bar, you must "shoutout" to ALL the people you know.
	OR
	- Write a mushy lovey dovey poem, saying i miss you, i love you, i want you, why cant i have you, i cant live without you, i am so desperate for some ass, you know..that kinda stuff..

	Well, the other definitions pretty much hit it [on the nose].
	
	But don't be like the junior high retards and pronounce it "EXANGA". Them, along with many dumbasses who use [Xanga] actually are stupid enough that they pronounce the "X" in Xanga to make it sound like "EXANGA". The "X" in "Xanga" is pronounce as a "Z". Pronounced "[Zanga]". Although middle school retards who are obsessed with Xanga can't even wrap their minds around the pronunciation even though they were taught how to pronounce "X" as a "Z" in the beginning of words in elementary school.
		Example: ZZZZZANGA
		
		You don't call someone named [Xander], "EXANDER".
		
		You don't [pronounce] the word "[Xylophone]" as "EXylophone"
		
		"X" used that as first letter in words is pronounced as a "Z"
		
		GET IT THROUGH YOUR HEADS.

	(2004-06-11 +134/-48)
	An online [diary] used to either write about ones pointless day or to write [brief] insparations or random thoughts in ones head. 
	 Some use it to write merely for themselves (if their site is not given out, they do not post on anyone [else's] site, and they have no other [connections] to their site, it would be pretty hard to find). 
	 Others use it to communicate with friends, and only their friends. 
	 And then there are some who search and search for other people's sites and read every aspect of their poor pathetic lives because they have stalker tendencies.
		Example: Ok, so my day was like this, [I have no life] so I sat on the couch with my daritos all day and watched soap opras because if you look beyond the poor acting and overdramitized women, they're actually pretty damn funny...
		I swear she's a dog trapped in a cat's body...
		This is much better then that old torn notebook and [Mik] wont [beable] to find this one...
		Hey you ass, why weren't you in English today, the transvestite whore was gone and we had the coolest sub...
		ooh, bobby from  [flordia], oh and his favortite sport is baseball, mine too, he has a girlfriend, i'm gonna kill that wench for stealling my man...

	(2006-04-10 +63/-21)
	Before there was [myspace] and [facebook], there was xanga.
		Example: [Xanga] [died] out to [myspace].

	(2006-01-11 +40/-20)
	A live-journal type website that people use to [complain] about their [pathetic] lives. 
	
	It was once popular, until [myspace] took over, where they could not only complain about their lives, but also put pictures up of them being "depressed" and "emo" because their lives "suck."
		Example: Xanga Entry:
		
		Like OMG!!!!! My life suxz soo much!!111 My ['rents] wont let me go 2 teh movie with Josh!!11!!1 [I just wanna die]! [No one understands me]!! blah blah blah blah.............

	(2005-04-23 +102/-74)
	Like [live journal], but more [Asian].
		Example: Those [Asians] [love] their Xangas

	(2004-01-14 +68/-47)
	I don't see why everybody's saying that it's only asians who type with alternating [capitals] and [bad spelling] that post there, since I do and I type with almost flawless spelling and grammar and I don't complain about my life or talk about my [suicidal tendencies].  I use it to get things down on "paper" so I can keep track of my life when it gets too hectic.  In any case, my definition of "xanga" is simply an internet based diary that other people (who choose to) can read and comment on.  I admit, it is dominated by poser asian 12-year-olds, but there are plenty of people who just use it to express themselves because it's more convenient than a diary or journal.  Beleive it or not, some people actually DO care and not everyone there is a preppy asian girl without a life.  End of story.
		Example: My xanga:
		
		Hello...I think this is a good way to express myself.  I also like to keep a wtch on [my brother's] stupid girlfriend.  Habits are hard to break....especially the "..." at all my [returns].....[oops]....

Xango Juice
	(2007-12-14 +402/-132)
	The latest edition of the oldest scam in the book: [The Pyramid Scheme]. This time it's the "multi-layered marketing" of a $25.00 bottle of magical juice made from a fruit called mangostein. Essentially it's the same juice you can buy from Cosco for about $2.00 a bottle. But you're not buying juice, as these [snake oil salesman] claim, you're buing a "distribution business" to make $100,000 a month in [passive income]. Yeah, you're buying a business that requires you to spend a minimum of $100 per month on overpriced juice. And to make money you have to get suckers to sign up to purchase $100 worth of juice a month and they have to get more people to sign up, ect. ect. ect. Then they tell you to write off any expenses you incurr (such as cable bills, beer costs, and internet access expenses)as "business expenses" related to your bogus juice business. I don't know what's more pathetic, the scam itself or the dozens of poor, dumb and desperate downtrodden idiots who show up to those Xango meetings listening to obvious plants in the audience claiming to make $200,000 a month in juice money.
		Example: Frank is 50, has a degree in gym, is divorced and  his entire retirement savings consists of fifty bucks and the [lottery ticket] he bought this morning. But now he has hope because he signed up to pay $100 a month for juice he doesn't even like in hope of someday earning $800,000 an year in [passive income] with his own Xango Juice [distribution] business.

	(2005-01-26 +16/-6)
	The [abridged] pronunciation of "[exclaimation point]."
	
	A word indicating excitement or alarm.
	
	Background:  This word was necessitated by attempts to read scripted [dialog] in which surprise was indicated using "!" or "!!!" out loud.  First adopted by screenplay writers, its public usage began with the excessive usage of the exclamation point in RPG dialog.  The facilitation of the pronunciation of the exclaimation point, as well as the onamotopoetic character lent by the word, allowed its use in everyday conversation.
		Example: Lich Lord:  "No, [AAMOF] it is the runtling behind you who bears your ancestors' secrets."
		
		Main Character: "[Xanth]!"
		
		Or:
		
		H. L. [Mencken] realizing how much he has written over the course of his lifetime: "Xanth!"

	At first a Xanthe my be mistaken for a common goth, this is a mistake commonly made by [amature] hunters.
	[Xanthe's] are a reclusive species and are thus hard to find, hence some tales that Xanthes are actully an urban legend.
	
	In the wild they will often be spotted sporting all black [atire] and will usually be adorned by a [ciggarette] in one [hand and a half] drunken bottle of wine in the other.
	
	The bottle of wine is used as part of a complex mating ritual. Xanthes generally have a very low alcohol tolerence and upon consuming a small amount will cause them to go into heat. The mating display of a Xanthe generally involves throughrelly licking the face of her chosen mate but will often make advances on many others before settling down to just one.
	
	The ciggarettes, however, are not just for show. Xanthes are very [tempermental] and have been known to lash out and use said ciggarette as a weapon, especially when they feel threatened or simply just bored. It is for this reason only experienced hunters should attempt to approach a Xanthe. [Amature] hunters should not under any circumstances attempt to approach, especially during early spring when it is liekly that the Xanthe is guarding her nest. 
	
	Between 40 and 50 Xanthe related deaths occur every year world wide.
	
		Example: "Early in '06 a [mate of mine] and I were [tramping] and it just came out of no where, I didnt know what was happening, it just [lept] out of the bushes. I managed to escape with only minor ciggarette burns but it got Ben, never saw him again. Park ranger said I was lucky to be alive, not many people survive a Xanthe attack."

Xaverians and ICANs
	(2007-11-24 +85/-783)
	Group of kids who study in either Xavier or ICA who think that getting laid is all about wearing People are People and acting emo even through most don't even know what the word means. ICANs have the most annoying accent in the world.
	
	To Xaverians and ICANs, emo is listening to My Chemical Romance and Fall Out Boy, crying while listening to Taking Back Sunday and having their hair cut at a Bench salon.
	
	Both have a knack for thinking that they actually deserve better than what they already have and speaking horrible English, or [Taglish] rather. This leads to the majority getting laid at 40.
	
	Xaverians think that they have a [fighting chance] with anyone else other than the ICANs who most still don't get even if they were to rub their [asses up] their faces. 
	
	Alright, so the cycle goes like this: [Xaverian] realizes that he has a dick and starts liking ICANs. Faggots gossip and the [ICAN] finds out. ICAN starts acting evasive and uninterested in Xaverian. ICAN and Xaverian finally meet out and schedule a date to [Rockwell] for a lack of choice. ICAN acts like she has a choice and turns down the Xaverian. Xaverian cuts wrist and bleeds to death. The cycle repeats. 
	
	ICANs are a cross between Richard Gere and [Paul Pierce]; not exactly my dream girl although there are the coveted few who actually look decent enough to be seen with.
	
	One can easily tell apart a Xaverian or an ICAN from the crowd. Just take note of the following:
	
	- Kris [Aquino] [taglish]
	- [Empire State Building] Hair OR
	- Hair cut such that it covers one side of the face; the look that Xaverians deem 'emo'
	- carries a shitload of money
	- shops at Rockwell ....
	with guys 
	- goes to Rockwell with guy friends...
	to talk
	- very tight pants, usually black and a black shirt.
	- converse chucks with the mandatory pentel pen marks; personalized others would like to say.
	- has a hard time talking to chicks...
	and even a harder time with guys. 
	- has a wide array of clothes... 
	which are all exactly the same but a lighter shade of black. 
	- takes black and white, sad or [emo pictures] of himself/herself and posts it in their multiply account under the title 'vain'.
	- conforming to trends that never were in like wearing black and white striped jackets over a black shirt while wearing black pants with chucks ruined by the graffiti over it. All  a major misinterpretation of the word 'style' and a huge [fashion faux pas]
	- carries a camera where ever they go.
	
		Example: Rich [Expatriate] Guy: Look, it's the Osbornes! All of them have 
		huge hair, eyeliner, the all black outfit and their pants are too tight to even fit their phones! [Hahahahaha]!
		
		Hot Girlfriend: [Hmmmm], they must be Xaverians and ICANs.

Xbox 1
	(2013-06-17 +78/-46)
	[The Xbox One] is an upcoming video game console from Microsoft. Announced on [May 21], 2013, it is the successor to the Xbox 360 and the third console in the Xbox family of consoles. But don't let the advertisements fool you. This is the worst game system known to man. This game system blocks all used games so your forced to buy each game brand new, Since its equipped with the [Kinect 2.0] the system is never fully turned off unless you cut off the power manually (Unplug power cord from wall), Certain games are [region locked] so if you live anywhere other than the United States be prepared to get certain games blocked and you can forget about a refund since all purchases are final, You cant play any of your games unless your connected to the internet and signed up for Xbox Live (Meaning you have to pay for online to play your games, even if its a single player game), and they have the saddest collection of exclusive games known to man.
		Example: [Go] [buy a] [Ps4] and not an Xbox 1

Xbox 1.5
	(2005-09-14 +151/-113)
	The name given to [Xbox 360] by people who fall in one of the following catagories:
	1) They are cranky because their favorite company doesn't release their next-gen console for another year or more.
	2) They have never seen a trailer for ANY Xbox 360 game.
	3) They were stupidly and completely [faked] out by the entirely prerendered trailer for the PS3 game [Killzone 2].
	4) Lack the brainpower to count to 360.
		Example: Xbox 1.5, [hee hee], I'm [so bad]. <I wish I could [count] past 7> :(

	(2005-05-23 +144/-161)
	Also known as [Xbox 360], this Xbox has [wireless] controllers and slightly upgraded [visuals], and looks like a tampon.
		Example: Microsoft didn't really add [anything new] in the [Xbox360] that can enhance gameplay. They just upgraded their graphics (slightly) and added [wireless] controllers (stolen from nintendo).

	(2005-09-14 +83/-128)
	A console manufactured by Microsoft in order to be sold as a "Next generation Xbox" and squeeze their few faithful client's pockets for a scam, because it doesn't include next-generation media like Blu-ray or [HD-DVD], it's not enabled to be [wirelessly] connected (to the internet) right out of the box, it doesn't include a mandatory Hard Drive like the actual generation's, it doesn't support all three Hi-Definition modes ([720p], 1080p, [1080i]; just the first two) when it brags about Hi-Definition, it makes the smallest [graphic's] leap in [console gaming] history, it doesn't support it's [predecessor's] games natively (they are emulated, and not all of the games will be playable), it supports less controllers than the competition (only four), and it mostly includes sequels. All this when the competition includes what this silly object does not.
	
	Also known as Xbox 360, an Xbox 360 1.5 (Or [Xbox 1.5] 1.5, whichever you choose to call it) is well under way too, because Microsoft has considered adding an almost next-generation (because its counterpart is in fact the next-generation for sporting higher capacity and more layer potential) disc, the soon to be obsolete HD-DVD player (but not for games, just for movies in an obsolete format by then), and maybe a TiVo two or three years after the Xbox 1.5 launch, alienating its earliest consumers while at the same time making it able to struggle with the competition, that will be already sporting these features and more the day it launches, or more accurately, two years before [xbox 1.5] 1.5 is launched.
	
		Example: I just bought my Xbox [1.5], and it quickly became obsolete.
		
		The Xbox [1.5's] successor will be called Xbox 1.5 1.5.
		
		The Xbox 1.5 is the best console because I actually have to pay for a service that is free.
		
		The Xbox 1.5 has the best [sequels] because it has the most.
		
		Microsoft ripped me off with the Xbox 1.5.

Xbox 360 Fanboy
	(2009-11-07 +230/-74)
	The [unyielding] belief that the [Xbox 360] is the best console, and no other can touch it. This of course, is only based upon the monopoly of exclusive games that the console has due to [Microsoft's] ass-loads of cash that they throw to developers, so that consumers are only left with one choice of console. The 'fanboys' completely disregard system performance, graphics, and other notable features that the other consoles have, and simply focus on the fact that "Halo is the best". They typically claim that the Xbox 360 is better because it has Xbox Live, and forget the fact that Microsoft charges for simple things like pictures and changing your name.
		Example: Scenario 1: Ps3 Owner "Hey dude, I just got a ps3 today and I'm watching my movies and playing my games on [Blu-Ray] HD!"
		
		Xbox 360 Fanboy "Dude why would you waste your money on that when you could be playing Halo?!?!?!?!!!"
		
		Scenario 2: Ps3 Owner "Hey, I just went online and downloaded a new theme for my Ps3 for free, then I decided I wanted to change my name to BawlsOut69!"

		[Xbox owner]: THEY ALL SUCK!!!!1!!
		Playstation owner: ...Have you even played them...?
		Xbox owner: Um... no...
		Playstation owner: Also, PS3's processor is much more powerful than [the Xbox's], and the Blu-rays hold eight times the amount of data the Xbox's DVDs hold... and-

It mainly consists of Mexicans, Indians (Like Dirka-Dirka Indians, not Buffalo and Casino Indians), and occasionally the very helpful white guy.  But that's if you're lucky. Don't be surprised if you get pissed with your "supporter" and he forwards you to The Head Supervisor. Which in the end is another Shitty-Speaking Mexican or an Indian who's name is Baka-Bakalaka [Dirka] Mohammed [Jihad], or Jose. In the end, shit is either resolved due to a simple fix, or turns into a [cluster-fuck] of annoyance and frustration with one of the biggest electronic producing companies in the world. Also Known as [Microshit].  And don't expect them to actually do anything when big problems occur. They'll call you back in a couple of days and say "I am sorry Sir/Ma'am, there is nothing we can do [Dirka Dirka] Dirka.

		Dumbass: Yes, I am! *falls down, dead*
		Me: [Hah]!  [Thats what] you get!

	(2005-05-08 +260/-113)
	They say that the Xbox is the best console out there just because the graphics are the best. The [Ps2] has the best games, and the [Gamecube] has the best [exclusives]. They don't understand this because their brain is way to small!

	The [unyielding] belief that the [Xbox 360] is the best console, and no other can touch it. This of course, is only based upon the monopoly of exclusive games that the console has due to [Microsoft's] ass-loads of cash that they throw to developers, so that consumers are only left with one choice of console. The 'fanboys' completely disregard system performance, graphics, and other notable features that the other consoles have, and simply focus on the fact that "Halo is the best". They typically claim that the Xbox 360 is better because it has Xbox Live, and forget the fact that Microsoft charges for simple things like pictures and changing your name.
		Example: Scenario 1: Ps3 Owner "Hey dude, I just got a ps3 today and I'm watching my movies and playing my games on [Blu-Ray] HD!"
		
		Xbox 360 Fanboy "Dude why would you waste your money on that when you could be playing Halo?!?!?!?!!!"

	Xbox Live is also becoming the new "[E-Harmony]" or "[Match.com]".
		Example: 1. "Another suicide sir."
		"What is it this time?"
		"[Poor bastard] [ODed] on Xbox Live and [shot up] his apartment and himself"
		
		2. "Xbox Live offers 9 dimensions of compatability!"

	(2009-01-02 +292/-61)
	Online gaming and communication service available to gamers on [the Xbox] and Xbox 360 game consoles.

Also available is a rating service to rate other players through "reputation", the main purpose of which is to give those players better than you negative rep for being "[Unsporting]" (i.e., they just kicked your ass)
		Example: Direct quotes from users in multiplayer game lobbies on Xbox Live:
		
		"Nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger (repeating)"

	2. You [can't hack] or modify the game without being banned
	3. Unlike PC's, Xbox 360 gaming will eventually become obsolete
	4. The audio of spoiled elementary school children playing games that are rated M and cursing in a squeaky and humorous tone (ex: You [fucking Noob]! Hax!)
	
	A famous game played on Xbox Live would be the Call of Duty Series. This game is meant to be for a mature audience, but it is generally played by children after they learn to walk. When CoD became popular, most kids stopped playing [Cowboys and Indians] outside and eventually converted into Communists vs Nazis. This game is also used to recruit idiotic teenagers (specifically jocks and stoners) that think they are tough to join the marines. These people turn into arrogant morons that think they are weapons experts and hardcore in which you pray for whatever god you believe in to smite them. Not all Xbox Live players are bad, but the few that are can ruin the experience.
		Example: A "civilized" conversation on Xbox Live:
		
		Stoner: Dude, I am pwning in Xbox Live you [fuckin bitches], fuck you!
		
		Prepubescant Child: You [fucking noob], [you can't do that] you pussy Hax!
		
		Spoiled Fatass Teenager: Shut up you faggot!

	(2011-01-19 +51/-13)

	(2011-01-09 +17/-3)
	An ingenious invention made by microsoft, ruined by [hard ass] [6th graders] with smoothÔªø [undropped] balls that think they're tough swearing after every sentence.

	(2010-04-05 +42/-11)
	1. An [online gaming] community for Xbox and [Xbox360] users to play games together from around the world for a small fee.
	
	2. An online gaming community where racist, homophobic, arrogant gamers usually hang around. They will attempt to insult random players in the game [chatrooms] before matches begin and fail to do so by the following: making pitiful mum jokes and overusing the word "faggot". The majority of this type of gamers have yet to reach puberty and play mature rated games, thinking they are hardcore. Some of them even attempt threats into hacking gamers' accounts and believe any player who do not perform as well as they do on any particular game have no right to play it.
		Example: *A random day on Xbox Live and in a random game of Halo 3 and a player is having an [off day], dying more and killing less than he usually does*
		
		Arrogant player: OH MY GOD YOU SUCK, FAGGOT! NEVER PLAY HALO AGAIN!
		
		Normal Player: Look, I'm having a bad day. Can you please stop?
		
		Arrogant Player: Shut up, N*****! Yo' ruining my good time with yo' mom!
		
		Normal Player: A joke about my mother. How original, mate.
		
		Arrogant Player: [F*** you], faggot.
		
		Normal Player: Y'know what? Come back and talk to me when you have finally managed to grow a brain and fill that [empty sack], made of skin, with a pair. *[mutes] arrogant player and sends file complaint*

Once they realize they aren't good enough to defeat a certain player, they resort to racial slurs and babble to annoy the opposing player. An [Xbox Live Dick's] bio is usually with sentences like " I'm unstoppable at Halo 3" or " I'm MLG at Call of Duty 4" and deragatory remarks towards women.

Also known as the ones who whine when it comes to loosing at a game. Not only that, but when they can't end a fight they began, they start using [the "N" word]! As they grow up, they will have a f'ed up life, tweeking out when someones says "GRENADE!" or "CAMPER!". Oh and one more thing, their parents fail. I mean, what kind of parent lets a 9 year old play this sort of stuff?! I mean, can you imagine seeing these sort of kids in school? THEY MUST BE BANNED, THE [MUTE BUTTON] ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH!

	(2009-07-22 +75/-28)
	A girl who regularly goes on [Xbox Live] to get guys, or rather their attention. This said girl is usually too pathetic and unattractive in real life to get attention from males, so they go on Xbox Live where their sheer voice alone would attract [dozens] of followers. Xbox Live Whores like to stay in parties or "clans" where there are no other females, allowing her to control and manipulate the males in the group in order to get the attention she craves. Xbox Live Whores like to also go into private chats with one or two members of the group, allowing her to divide the once peaceful brotherhood and force the males in the group to compete over her affection. These girls are usually darker haired or emo, and slightly overweight. Their natural habitat was strictly Halo 3 custom games, but massive communities of Xbox Live Whores have migrated to [Call of Duty 4] and [Left 4 Dead].

Xbox One
	(2014-02-10 +210/-82)
	[Microsoft's] latest addition to the Xbox console franchise, which has been debuted in May of 2013. The successor to the Xbox 360, the One sports more high a performance hardware, support for higher resolutions and 60 frames per second, much like (in some cases) a midrange [gaming computer]. With it's somewhat updated graphics unit and 8 GB of RAM, the One is a technological [step up] from the 360.
	This console has been the center of ridicule in the gaming community for well over six months, up until it's release in November. Because there were growing concerns over [DRM] and restricted library issues, a majority of consumers diverted their attention to the upcoming PS4. however, after its release, the One was able to stand up on its own as a [formidable] gaming platform. Well over 4.2 million units around America have been installed and are being actively used by gaming enthusiasts every day. Even so, as the One has surprised a number of gamers and consumers, it still comes [under fire] from multiple sides; dedicated Sony fans and the other half of Microsoft; PC.
	All arguments aside, the One has finally shown some potential as a decent gaming machine, and the author is curious to see what content becomes available for it as the year goes on.
		Example: Man 1: My Xbox One finally came in the other day. Loving the [step up] from last generation.
		
		Man 2: That's cool. My [PS4] is pretty awesome, too. Shame we don't have cross-console games yet.

	This thing will be a failure. It requires you to connect to the Internet once every 24 hours in order to play games. [Kinect] is required for it to work. You have to pay a fee to play used games. Games have to be installed in order to play and it has a hard drive that holds a mere 500 GB. It was officially announced in a [live stream] on [May 21st], 2013.
		Example: I was going to buy the new Xbox, but I [changed my mind] when I saw [the Xbox One] [announcement].

	(2013-06-28 +199/-161)
	[The Xbox One] is an upcoming video game console from Microsoft. Announced on [May 21], 2013, it is the successor to the Xbox 360 and the third console in the Xbox family of consoles. But don't let the advertisements fool you. This is the worst game system known to man. This game system blocks all used games so your forced to buy each game brand new, Since its equipped with the [Kinect 2.0] the system is never fully turned off unless you cut off the power manually (Unplug power cord from wall), Certain games are [region locked] so if you live anywhere other than the United States be prepared to get certain games blocked and you can forget about a refund since all purchases are final, You cant play any of your games unless your connected to the internet and signed up for Xbox Live (Meaning you have to pay for online to play your games, even if its a single player game), and they have the saddest collection of exclusive games of all time.
		Example: [Go] [buy a] [Ps4] and not an Xbox One

	(2013-10-13 +102/-81)
	[Microsoft's] next [game console], [successor] (or possibly loser) to the Xbox 360.

		PS4: Wonder if it can get [viruses]....

	(2014-07-13 +42/-49)
	A console made by Microsoft released in November 2013 in the category of next-gen just like PS4. Many people said this would be a flop, and it isn't. It has EPIC graphics, good games, great [indie games], and in my opinion the best multiplayer experience. It's good. For a price of $[520].00 in the U.S. is an Xbox One, Xbox Live (multiplayer card), and a videogame, With Xbox Live Gold you can get 50-75% deals on games for download and get free indie games that normally are valued at $15.00. It comes with a nice XBOX Menu just like the menu at any [Windows computer] or phone with little interactive boxes. It's awesome. Just epic!
		Example: Since [the XBOX One] was announced many [Xbox 360] gamers and Microsoft lovers [went crazy].

	(2015-05-13 +39/-58)
	This Console Is The Best! I Got For $350 And It Included 3 Assassins Creed Games! Also I Can Stream Off Of Twitch And Call People Off Of Skype! Also Halo And Forza Are Exclusive To Xbox One. COD We Get [DLCS] First. The [Kinect] Is Better Than The 360 One, And It Includes A Camera. The Console Itself Is Boss. PS4 SUCKS DICK!!!!!!!!!!  The Only Thing To Make Xbox One Better Is [Five Nights At Freddys] Is A Xbox One Exclusive
		Example: [XBOX ONE] IS [BOSS]!!! [PS4] SUUUUUUCCCCCCCCCKKKKSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!

A great piece of hardware that doesn't compete with PlayStation because it already shits all over it, everyone already knows that Sony can and never will be able to compete with Microsoft so their focused on corporations like Amazon and Google who can try but [like Sony] will fail. A system that will put Sony's LameStation out of it's misery and finally bankrupt Sony for good. A console like every other gen will dominate in everything, especially after pushing into every other country and making FailStation even more irrelevant than it already is.
		Example: Xbox Series X is going to be an extremely high quality, superior platform like the brand [always has been]. [Sony] cunts and PC fags can cry when they're getting stomped like the [sissified] queers they are.

		[xbox sex] is [not ideal] with puberty dick. Magnul XL girth and length preferred for her pleasure with minimum motions especially ribbed or many veins. Seven'' length by five and a half'' girth any less is short or skinny or both. [Go soft] for stealth unmount after either orgasm or surprise parental visit mid stroke.
		
		Both lean over to anal spoon from xbox sex with heads towards door or parental observation direction for counter-surveillance switching to anal orifice as [cum receptacle].Better than average length makes position transition easier.

		[Bubba]: "Yep, he's [sporting] a real xbox tan"

xennial
	(2017-07-20 +97/-14)
	[Xennial] is the new term for the microgeneration of people born between [1977] and [1983].
		Example: For many of us "older millenials", we have always resented the term. It has become synonymous with being entitled, apathetic, and self absorbed. Many [Baby Boomers] see them as a [blight] on the nation, which has sparked some pretty funny memes. As an older millennial I always resented being [lumped] in with this group. You see, we came of age before social media and iphones, we were raised in an analog world, and dropped into a digital universe. We are xennials.

Xenoblade
	(2012-07-09 +122/-15)
	The holy grail of modern RPGs today, a true revival of the [JRPG], and the reason for gamers to dust off their Nintendo Wii. The only relation this game has to the similarly named [Xenogears] and Xenosaga is the fact that they were all created by [Tetsuya] [Takahashi]. Unlike those games, however, Xenoblade boasts one of the largest open worlds this side of Skyrim. In addition, it has an epic battle system, fantastic art direction, a story that (for the most part) doesn't play into traditional JRPG tropes, and beautiful music.
	
	While graphics whores, Call of Duty addicts and console fanboys have denigrated this game due to the simple fact that it's a JRPG on the Wii, almost everyone else has given it well-deserved praise.
		Example: Fanboy 1: [The Wii's] on its [last legs], and it's always sucked!
		Fanboy 2: Meh, this game looks like [JRPG] garbage.
		Fanboy 3: Those graphics are shit!
		Me: *shows fanboys a review of the game*
		Fanboys: Ah...that actually looks really, really good...
		Me: Wow, Xenoblade has really been turning fanboys across the spectrum into converts.

	(2020-12-18 +13/-1)
	An underrated JRPG on the Wii, New Nintendo 3ds, and Nintendo Switch. Known for its great story and themes, the blone anime [swordie] in Smash Bros who can see the future for some random reason, and that one random furball named Riki who's a meme
	Btw [Reyn] is a character in that game, know for his quote "its [reyn time]!"
		Example: "It's [Reyn time] to play Xenoblade Chronicles!"
		"No one knows what Xenoblade Chronicles is; its [pretty good] [tho]"

xenochrist
	(2009-01-11 +125/-16)
	a song titled [XenoChrist] appears on the album [Planetary Duality] by the Technical death metal band, [The Faceless]. It is derived from an almagamation of two words, xeno and Christ.
		
	'Xeno' is prefix, derived from a latin word best translated as 'foreigner', or 'stranger.' It is usually used to denote an object that is alien, unusual, or extra-terrestrial.
	
	Christ well, we all know who that is.
	
	The song carries many of the Faceless' staples, such as gutural vocals, complex time signatures, heavily saturated guitar tones and vast amounts of technical profency by all musicians. Perhaps slightly out of character are the soaring keyboard melodies at the end of the song.
		Example: Dude have you heard [XenoChrist]?!
		
		[Ya man], that song is so fucking [rad]
		

_____

Xenogears
	(2005-03-07 +108/-13)
	A [role-playing] game released for the Sony Playstion in 1998. It is well-known to have a very complex and [intricately] written storlyine that is filled with western theological references and metaphors. Developed by [Squaresoft].
		Example: "[I am the] [alpha and omega],
		 the first and the last, 
		 the beginning and the end"
		                  -from [opening] movie

	(2009-07-13 +44/-9)
	Xenogears is a [JRPG] developed and published by Squaresoft. It came out 1998 for the Playstation 1.
	The game is about a young man named Fei who lives in the small village of [Lahan]. But when a squad of robotic war machines called 'Gears' [crash land] in [Lacan] an unfortunate event changes [Fei's] life completely...
	
	The game's most outstanding feature is it's very deep and complex story heavily influenced by Animes like Neon Genesis Evangelion and [Ghost in the Shell]. It handles topics like religion and human relationship very critical.
	
	Unfortunately Square decided to use some of Xenogears budget for their mediocre 8th installment of Final Fantasy. The result was a major change in story telling from CD1 to CD2. While you play out most of the plot on CD1, CD2's storytelling is more like a book and rushes through the story, unfortunately.
	
	Currently there is no sequel planned, even though many people would appreciate it more than a new fancy, flashy and shallow Final Fantasy.
		Example: <Moron> Dude, [Final Fantasy 7's] story is da best, [no game] could ever match that!
		<Me> Then I recommend [you play] Xenogears, but it might be too much for your brain.

	(2003-05-23 +160/-26)
	a [Squaresoft] [RPG] ([role playing] game) for the Sony Playstation; most intellectually stimulating and emotionally deep RPG ever made; 
		Example: People need to play [Xenogears] in order to understand [Xenosaga]; quit [bashing] on Episode I already -_-!

	(2003-10-11 +107/-43)
	The name of [the best game ever] made. Usually used to describe [perfection]. Opposite to Finaly [Fantasy] 8.
		Example: 1. That girl [Nadia] is sooo xenogears, glad i met her in my [lifetime].
		
		2. You call this a xenogears, this program of yours is worse than [a final fantasy] 8.

	(2003-09-14 +34/-83)
	A video game for the Sony Playstation Entertainment System that drew from numerous different theological and philosophical ideas. Half the fun is in guessing these references. The other half is in finding the right mind-altering substance that makes [the plot] [coherent] [in your mind].
		Example: Not even [a hit] of [acid] makes Xenogears' [plot] make any sense.

_____

Xenohomophobic
	(2011-04-12 +70/-9)

Xenogender
	(2022-05-16 +53/-20)
	Xenogedner is all non-binary/[genderqueer] gender related to person [intrest]. These gender identities are typically defined metaphorically in relation to animals, plants, things or sensory characteristics. Some nonbinary people have mental variations (mental illnesses, neurological conditions, or neurodivergence). Some who have mental variations see these as an influence on-- or an inseparable part of-- their [gender identity]. These are called neurogenders, and most of them are not described on this page, but on the neurogender page. A person can have more than a one [xenogender]. Some people find it easier to perceive their gender identity by evoking familiar archetypes. Instead of giving references to how their gender relates to maleness and femaleness, they say their gender is-- or is like-- a kind of animal, an imaginary being, a part of nature, an abstract concept, or a symbol.
		Example: [Alex] said that he is [catgender], that means that he uses [xenogender].

	(2022-01-21 +69/-44)
	[Xenogender] is a term that is used to refer to describe what someone's gender feels like to them. It is a great tool that many use to express their individuality and how they feel they are inside, and was originally intended to help neurodivergent people discuss their gender with others.
	
	People who use [xenogenders] don't actually identify their gender as the word they've used [prefacing] "-gender". (ex. cat-gender doesn't mean that person identifies as a cat.)
	
	There is a misconception that using one of these makes someone trans and/or nonbinary. This is untrue. [Xenogenders] are made for everyone to find what describes them best, and even cisgender people can (and do) use them and new neopronouns to describe their more unique feelings of themselves to others.
	
	However, it is primarily LGBT+ people, particularly nonbinary people, who use them currently. But that doesn't mean that you can assume the gender of someone based on a [xenogender] identity. (For example, binary trans people use these as well, and using a xenogender doesn't make them a nonbinary person.)
		Example: "I heard that person is using a [xenogender] [catgender] and cat pronouns now. What, they identify as a cat?"
		
		"Actually, no. Someone who is [cat gender] isn't identifying as a cat. They aren't trans-species. That person probably feels that cat's gender is small and warm or something like that. I'm sure cat would be willing to explain it to you if you asked cat."

	(2020-10-15 +491/-388)
	A Xenogender is a gender that is made for peoples interests/struggles. It is most commonly used by neurodivergentpeople because they have more intense interests than others. Some [neurodivergent] people have a more [complicated relationship] with gender so these [help with] that also!
		Example: Josh is [autistic] and using a [xenogender] helps them with being comfortable with their [gender]

	(2021-07-12 +295/-247)
	A [xenogender] is a gender that can't be entirely described by human concepts of gender, like male, female, or no gender.
	
	It can be complicated, but [xenogenders] are often described as feeling like objects, sensations, songs, feelings, concepts, etc.
	
	Some people may create xenogenders based on things of comfort/interest to them.
	
	[Xenogenders] are not transphobic and they are completely valid and real.
		Example: [Ringo]: I have a [xenogender]! Mine feels like the way bubbles look and move when you blow on them.
		Riley: Sweet! My [xenogenders] don't feel like that, but one of mine feels like the way my keyboard feels when I press the keys.
		Marco: I don't have xenogenders, but I'm not going to be a jerk and pretend I know your gender better than you guys do. I'm glad you've found yourselves. :D

	(2022-05-23 +53/-38)
	a gender that is mostly associated with animals, aesthetics, and feelings, but can be other things too!
	Common [Xenogenders] are [catgender], pupgender, [bungender], sweetgender, and faegender. Most Xenogender users use neopronouns that correlate with their gender, such as kit/kitself/pup/pupself/bun/bunself/sweet/sweetself/fae/faeself/ Xenogenders are totally valid and help neurodivergent people understand what they identify as! Xenogenders that identify with animals do not mean that if you identify with them you identify as a cat, though this is a common misconception.
		Example: person 1: I identify as beegender and fluffcoric!!!
		person 2: wha- whats that?
		
		person 1: They are [xenogenders], they are what i identify as!
		person 2: doesn't that stupid [meowbahh] brat identify as [catgender]??? don't tell me you like meowbahh
		person 1: NO OF COURSE NOT!!! meowbahh is not really part of the lgbtqia+ community, its some guy pretending to be catgender and starting discourse over things
		person 2: well- its only man, woman, and nonbinary [spec]!!
		person 1: yeah! xenogenders are nonbinary spec, because they aren't man or woman!
		person 2: oh! you are very valid, i understand now :)
		person 1: thanks! we face lots of transphobia and exclusion in the lgbtquia+ community, so thats very kind :3

	(2020-10-15 +205/-205)
	Xenogender isn't defined in relation to "female" or "male" (the [binary] [genders]), but by other kinds of ideas that most people don't think of as having to do with gender. Typically oneself chooses things they like to more accuratly decribe themselves better then they think binary [labels] could do.
		Example: Person 1: "I use the [xenogender] [catgender]! I use [nya]/nyaself because they are fun and make me feel comfortable!"
		
		Person 2: "That's cool! I use puppygender because I have a complex identity regarding gender, I know I'm not a dog btw!"

	(2022-08-26 +15/-10)
	A gender that is completely out of the [gender binary] and is only for people who are [neuro] [divergent]. These genders can be anything and are usually connected to certain things like animals, food, characters etc.
		Example: ‚Äú[Hey], I [use] [xenogenders]!‚Äù

	(2021-12-10 +166/-183)
	A 'gender' that is based on a person's interest, preferred aesthetic, or feelings. It is said to be made for neurodivergent people because 'they may have a different way of understanding gender' or 'gender is too difficult for them to understand'. Xenogender is not a gender, it is supporting the misconception of 'gender is feeling'; gender is the state of one being either male, female, or neither in the [gender spectrum] (followed by transgender and non-binary people). Xenogender is also made by a [neurotypical] ([allistic]) person on Tumblr.
		Example: A: "I heard Kai is [xenogender] [catgender] and uses [nya]/nyaself pronouns. Is this a new thing in the LGBT+ community?"
		B: "No, it's just a random person who Tumblr who created these genders for fun. It is never meant to be part of the LGBT+ community. He also deleted his original Tumblr account later on."
		A: "Yikes."

	(2022-02-11 +166/-193)
	Something [Tumblr Users] used to mock [LGTBQ]+ people way back, it‚Äôs not real because ‚ÄúNeurodivergent people don't understand gender the same way as most people! Shut the fuck up! We are not [bumbling idiots] that are retarded. It‚Äôs not real!
		Example: A. I believe in Xenogender
		C. It‚Äôs [not real]
		A. [HOW DARE YOU]!
		C. [Cry me a river].

	(2020-10-14 +136/-161)
	A form of [self expression] often used by neruodivergent people.
	
	[Xenogenders] are ways to describe ones gender.
	
	Ask someone how they'd describe their gender and you'll probably [get stuff] like "blue" or "tough" (masculine stuff for guys usually).
		Example: I [use] [Xenogenders]! I use [catgender] and beegender!

Xenomorph
	(2007-10-13 +329/-62)
	Phase one - Egg, A soft  pod that contains Phase two of Xenomorph Development
	
	Phase two - [Facehugger], A Spiderlike creature with a tail that implants an [Embryo] into the throat of the being it [latched] onto*, It's tail wraps around, and constricts the throat, so as to cause the victim to lose conciousness. Then, To prevent host death, It gives the host small amounts of oxygen from two [sacs] behind the legs of the Facehugger. Once the [embryo] is implanted, it sinks down into the upper chest of the host, where it gestates. As soon as the Embryo loses touch with the implantation 'tongue' of the [facehugger], the facehugger detatches and dies. Then the Embryo grows into [Phase three].
	
	Phase three - [Chestburster], The Production of the embryo, it's name comes into play when it is fully grown. Where it digs/eats it's way through the hosts internal organs, bones, and chest, and 'bursts' out. Depending on the host, the Xenomorph may be of varied sizes immediately [after birth]. Human and [Yautja] Borne-Xenomorph chestbursters are relatively small, but Dog and cat, and soforth borne Xenomorphs grow until they no longer fit in [the host's] stomach, then they 'burst'. The Chestbursters gnerally take familiar traits from the host Humans 'give birth' to Xenomorphs with Humanly capabilities, such as [Bipedalism]. Once a Chestburster is born, It immediately looks to feed, once it has done so, It sheds it's [chestburster] skin and fully grows into Phase four.
	
	Phase four - Fully-Grown Xenomorph, Having fed and grown, It meets it's final stage of life. Now that it has inherited all the traits it needed to grow, It no longer changes. Depending on the physical abilities of the host, now factor into it's job in [the colony]. If it was born from a Marine, It would grow as a Warrior or a soldier, If it was born from something that was unemployed, or a working class person, It would be a Drone, a worker. Usually Xenomorphs born from lower life forms, such as dogs and cats, Are used as scouts and runners. Yautja-Borne Xenomorphs are usually [cast out], or left unused by the Queen.
	
	Classes of Xenomorphs
	
	[Drones]#1: Singular Drones, Usually cast out, or first-births**, They aren't used to [Hive] work, and usually make their own mock [hives], for food.
	
	Hive Drones#[4/5]: Drones are workers, they secrete [the hive]. They follow the exact orders given to them, even if it includes harming the queen. They will also harm others of theirs, if it is necessary to follow [the queens] orders.
	
	Runners#3: Lower-births**, they are sent out to scout out more places to expand the hive, and report to the queen, as she is [immobile]. They have thinner bones, but stronger appendage muscles*** To help them run. But as it also seems, it helps them capture prey if necessary.
	
	Soldiers#6: Extremely powerful muscles, and thicker bones, to make them powerful to destroy, But it also slows and weighs them down. They are not protectors by any means, They are sent to make war against deadlier threats. Usually they aren't even birthed, because the [Xenomorph's] usually assimilate everything, instead of destroy it.
	
	Warriors#2: The bridge between [drones] and Soldiers, They protect and fight [for the queen]. They have thicker bones and stronger muscles, but not as thick or strong as the Soldier, to balance them out.
	
	Pr√¶torians - seven are born, and protect the queen, nothing else. They are born after the queen, but live much longer, to protect the queens final-laid egg, her successor. They die out after the Praetorian eggs are born. They are bigger, stronger, somewhat undersized queens. They have powerful, small arms proof, skin.
	
	Queens#2/4/5 - The Largest Xenomorph, one of it's kind is birthed to a [hive] from the previous one. This is the complete Schbang, she gives birth to the eggs, and orders all of the Xenomorphs born, ALL OF THEM. She is secreted to an Egg chamber, where the Eggs come out from. However, if the situation calls for it, she can detatch from the egg laying device. Since she is noramlly secreted to the wall, she has little balance, and stutter-steps around when free.
	
	*-Queens and Pr√¶torians have their own Special Facehuggers
	**-Born before a queen, casting them out of a hive.
	***-Born from a lower creature, like a cat, or a dog, or an Ox.

	The opposite of somebody who fears foreigners/strangers: the [xenophobe], comes the far more annoying counterpart: the xenophile. Looks for any and every reason to strike up a conversation with a stranger in any and every situation, especially in situations where it would be considered odd to do such a thing--i.e. on an elevator, the bus or next stall in a public bathroom. Xenophiles typically are [undaunted] by a person who repeatedly gives signs that they do not want to, or are not into socializing, and will continue their [onslaught] of endless questions or observations, regardless of this. In most cases, a true xenophile will only use another person as a front to [talk out] loud, and hence, expressing their own ideas and opinions so that others will be forced into hear them. Often, a xenophile conversation will continue on and on without the other person's/victim's giving the xenophile any encouragement to do so.

[Gameplay] is satisfying to those who are patient. Many may not agree with this definition, but fuck them, they should give it a better chance, it deserves it.

xenu
	(2005-07-14 +478/-57)
	A [Scientologist] deity - an [intergalactic] [tyrant] trapped in an everlasting force-field - and an excellent imaginary scapegoat. Scientologists blame him for all our problems, and you should too.
		Example: Teacher: Jimmy, you failed your [math test].
		Jimmy: (pointing at [sky]) Damn you, [Xenu]!!

	(2008-04-16 +110/-19)
	The evil [galactic] overlord that stupid, stupid, gullible people known as "scientologists" believe to have wiped out billions of aliens on Earth [75 million] years ago. Then [Xenu] collected their souls, known as 'Thetans', subjected them to brainwashing (how ironic) before releasing them back into the world, where they possessed our bodies and caused all of our problems.
		Example: "[Check check] check it holmes, I'm gunna [pimp-slap] Lord Xenu an' his [Thetans] by givin' mah life's savings to some crooks, aiiiiiight! That shit be TIGHT!!! Then I'm going to live in a cardboard box under a bridge."

	(2006-08-13 +163/-63)
	[Xenu] was a benevolent ruler, with only the best interests of the Galactic [Confederacy] in mind. Seventy-five million years ago, the Confederacy was in an awful state of affairs. Gross overpopulation threatened to destroy the already fragile ecosystems and economies of many planets in the Galactic Confederacy, and Xenu knew that he had to do something. He could stand idly by and watch the planets destroy themselves, or he could take action. Thankfully, our [Dark Lord] knew what he had to do. 
	
	With his Galactic Fleet consisting of millions of space planes, Xenu used an innocent ruse of "income tax inspections" and used the friendly help of pyschiatrists to lure and administer harmless injections to billions of Confederate aliens into his fleet of ships. They were to be the sacraficial lamb for the greater good. They were subsequently frozen and packed into the space planes for removal. This was completely painless for the citizens involved. 
	
	Taking our alien [lambs] to [Teegeeack] (known as "Earth" to humans) our Dark Lord Xenu ordered his [Exalted] [Renegades] to latch the aliens to volcanoes where he quickly and humanely eliminated them. However, Xenu did not take into account the souls of the alien lambs. The souls, called "[Thetans]" by some, flew free. Xenu knew that they needed to be re-educated to forget about what had [transpired], so he ordered the Exalted Renegades to catch the souls in Elecric Ribbons and re-educate them using a 3D Super-Colossal Motion Picture. The souls were given visions of modern worldly religions and then released to the world suffering from a loss of identity. 
	
	The re-educated souls [flocked] together to form [clusters] and inhabited the few remaining bodies that survived the explosions. These souls have transferred from person to person throughout each individual's [life cycle]. These clusters of souls are known to some as "Body Thetans," but the true followers off Xenu refer to them merely as "Soul [Clusters]." Some believe they cause all of the problems of mankind. However, this is not true. Instead, they grant us immense inner power. 
	
	But, as many things are, it was not to be. During the mass alien Exodus, Lord [Xenu's] Exalted Renegades were locked in heated battle with a group of evil disbelievers who addressed themselves as "Loyal Officers." They may be loyal, but not to Xenu. Rumor has it that the Loyal Officers are trying to reform, but that has mostly been dismissed as nonsense. 
	
	The Loyal Officers were defeated once, then retreated to the dark corners of the Confederate territory to [regroup] and rebuild. With a [surprise attack], the Loyal Officers ambushed our merciful Dark Lord. They ruthlessly enslaved him in a force-field prison that is powered by an eternally-charged battery.

	(2005-02-23 +701/-90)
	[Xenu] is the one that $cient0l0gists fear and hate most.

	Altough [Xenuphobia] is often believed to be caused by a severe lack of common sense combined with mild to severe insanity, it is actually caused by belief in Scientology, a religion created by [L. Ron Hubbard], who must therefore be considered the most clever man of the 20th Century.

Xenutarian
	(2022-02-18 +155/-0)
	A [devotee] of the galactic overlord [Xenu]. Xenutarians believe that enlightenment can be achieved by encouraging and sustaining the attachment of vast numbers of body [thetans] to our bodies. Xenu created body thetans by using hydrogen bombs to liberate spirits from their limited physical forms, allowing them to attain higher levels of spiritual existence. Xenu then imparted his vast wisdom to the body thetans through colossal 3D movies. When body thetans are attached to our bodies, they share [the wisdom] of Xenu with us so that we can attain enlightenment.
	
	Xenutarians believe that Scientologists have been sadly deceived by a corrupted version of the true story of Xenu.
		Example: Xenutarian 1: "Why can't those Scientologists think for themselves?"
		Xenutarian 2: "Sadly they have disconnected themselves from [the wisdom] of [Xenu] by removing their body [thetans]. Without body thetans, they are susceptible to cult indoctrination."

xerxes
	(2007-05-30 +317/-108)
	Most of the other definitions were written by 14 year old kids who liked 300 a bit too much. In reality, [Xerxes] was an Emperor of the [Persian Empire] before [Alexander the Great] conquered it. He didn't look a thing like he did in the movie, btw. And he wasn't gay.

He was not at all gay like depicted in the movie "300", that movie was so inaccurate.  King Xerxes married Esther a Jewish young woman who saved many Jewish people during the persecution of Jews in [Persian Empire].  She pleaded with her husband to spare the lives of her people, the Jews and he did, giving them the right to defend themselves in his kingdom.  The story of [Queen Esther] and King Xerxes can be read in the Bible or seen in the ACCURATE movie "One Night with the King."

	Xerxes ([Khashayar]) was born around 520 BCE in the southern province of Persis (Fars). He was a powerful king who ruled Achaemenid Persian Empire from 486-465 BCE.

He had been designated official heir perhaps as early as 498 BCE, and while crown prince he had ruled as the King's governor in Babylon.

xigdem
	(2007-11-07 +55/-10)
	A Kingdom Hearts yaoi pairing between [Xigbar] and [Demyx]. While not half as popular as the well established pairs such as [AkuRoku] or SoraRiku, it does have a fair amount of popularity in the Kingdom Hearts fandom. It is typically seen as a crack pairing, due to the fact that over the course of Kingdom Hearts II Xigbar and Demyx have no contact with one another.
	
	Where or why it originated it a bit obscure. It seems to make most sense that it originated from the popular theory the Demyx is one of the youngest members of Organization XII and Xigbar is the eldest. This is slightly akin to AkuRoku, seeing as Roxas is 15, and Axel is typically thought of to be an adult.
	
	Another reason might be that [Xigbar's] voice carried the tone of a steriotypical 'surfer dude', while [Demyx's] element is water.
		Example: Person 1: I'm looking for some interesting crack pairs, can you think of any? I'm thinking maybe somthing with [Demyx].

	(2006-03-24 +92/-10)
	The [XM] is a [large car] built by French manufacturer PSA [Peugeot] [Citroen] between 1989 and 2000.
	The XM is regarded as an excellent car by enthusiasts, who relish it's rock bottom second hand values, and enjoy equipment and trim levels similar, or even superior to that of other luxury cars such as BMWs and Mercedes.
	Universally and somewhat undeservedly feared by the non-initiated public, and Citroen dealers alike. Not a car for the faint hearted, or those afraid to get their hands dirty. That said, most the stories about [the car's] legendary complexity are easily dispelled with a little research / advice from fellow owners. It's actually not that hard to understand (nor that unreliable) when you see how it's supposed to work.
	In spite of this, mechanics at service departments cower in fear when an XM pulls up outside. The Citroen dealer [network's] knowledge of the car in some markets, particularly the UK and Ireland, is utterly abysmal. 
	Perhaps this is due in part to the low sales of [XM's] in these markets, meaning that they have little / no experience of the car. Indeed, some of the younger service technicians profess to never having seen one.
	As a result of this, rare is the XM enthusiast who would trust a main dealer to go anywhere near his beloved car. Most owners tend to be self supporting, though many reliable independent garages who specialise in Citroens do exist, and are widely utilised by those in the know.
	Numerous excellent internet resources exist for the discussion of XM's, including the XM-L list on Yahoo Groups. www.citroenet.org.uk is another excellent [fountain of knowledge] on [XMs], and [Citroen's] in general.
	
	Looks wise, you could be forgiven for believing the XM to be the result of crossing a whale with a [Delorean]. It's pointed, angular, almost fierce looking, aerodynamic front gives way to a large, wide rear. It is also reminiscent of a 'cheese wedge' shape, which it is sometimes referred to as. Time has been kind to the XM's features, and it looks futuristic even today, some 17 years after it's initial debut. Indeed, it's striking looks resemble nothing else on the road, and it still draws stares from bewildered passers-by. 
	A [facelift] 'Series 2' version was released in 94-95, in which the front [grille] was changed to match the 'corporate nose' already worn by the smaller, but less distinctive [Xantia]. There were many other changes to interiors, engines, and specifications, but many XM enthusiasts prefer the original Series 1 front grille, and the highly unusual single spoke steering wheel, which offers an unobstructed view of the highly packed instrument panel.  
	
	The XM is often referred to as 'The Enterprise, --Millennium Falcon--', and other sci-fi euphemisms, due to the fact that it has more gadgets, buttons, and lights than you would find on the console of a starship.
	Performance wise, it is an intergalactic motorway mile muncher. It is content to sit at 90mph on the motorway all day, [without so much as a] [whimper], it's passengers in perfect comfort the whole time. Indeed, due to the superior [hydraulic] suspension system, and excellent handling, many XM drivers report feeling alert and refreshed, even after a particularly long journey.
	[The car's] dynamically adapting Hydractive system, fitted to all UK standard models, allows for highly [spirited driving] on twisty, bumpy roads, without diminishing passenger comfort or safety. Indeed, drivers of smaller, supposedly more nimble cars are often left [gobsmacked] as it blasts into the distance, after they make the mistake of [goading] one into a race on a roundabout or snaking country road. The look of bewilderment upon their faces is indicative of the fact that they clearly did not expect such agility from this old, heavy, wallowing French barge. In the words of an infamous XM owner "The XM moves like an 18 stone ballet dancer".
	
	[The estate] models are renowned for their utterly cavernous boot space. Indeed, they have been known to swallow washing machines and tumble driers whole, in a TARDIS like fashion, whilst still leaving space for the rest of the kitchen contents. 
	
	The XM is the successor to the legendary Citroen [CX], and precedes the new Citroen [C6].
	The XM shared a platform with [PSA's] other car, the Peugeot [605], which ironically, was also one of it's main competitors. Other adversaries include the [Renault] Safrane in the domestic French market, and the Ford [Granada] and [Vauxhall]/[Opel] Senator internationally.
	
	The XM isn't perfect, and can exhibit a plethora of strange, and often [bewildering] faults. That said, the majority of these are minor, though their relatively [high frequency] may go part way to explaining the car's reputation of being unreliable. These minor issues are a common source of frustration and amusement among XM owners. Many problems are well known and documented, and indeed are not to dissimilar to problems that most cars of this age and specification experience.
	One amusing side to this is the use of 'XM Radio'. This is not to be confused with the [Sattelite] based radio service of the same name. Instead, it involves tuning the car's radio to a particular FM frequency, and then driving around listening for the whines which signify the operation of the electrovalves in the hydraulic system. This is a commonly used, and useful tactic to [troubleshoot] problems with the Hydractive suspension system.
	
	The XM is reportedly on the edge of being afforded 'classic' car status. It is already somewhat of a cult-mobile, something which is set to intensify as numbers diminish and the cars become rarer still.
	
	A truly great car, technologically light-years ahead of it's time, underappreciated, misconstrued, and feared. 
	Brilliant !
	
		Example: What the hell is THAT THING ?
		Oh, a Citroen XM, one of those weird [French] cars...
		They're [unreliable] aren't they ?
		
		Why are you driving that, it's [FRENCH] ?!?

	(2013-03-07 +25/-2)
	Satellite radio with a much broader range of music and content than standard [FM] radio. With Sirius XM, you are not limited to hearing the same song played every 20 minutes as with FM radio. With over [130] different stations, all with different genres of music, [the selection] available with Sirius XM is well worth the money for those spending a lot of time driving
		Example: "Hey I never heard the radio play such [good music], it's also [uncensored]"
		
		"That's because it's Sirius XM, not that [FM] garbage"

	(2005-05-14 +106/-96)
	[Satellite] [radio] [service] that is superior to all others.
		Example: [Opie and Anthony] [broadcast] on XM Satellite Radio.

xmas
	(2003-12-23 +547/-105)
	An abbreviation for Christmas, from [the Greek] spelling of [Christ], the first letter of which was [chi] ("X").
		Example: [Merry] [X-mas].

	(2010-12-19 +66/-33)
	The [festive] holiday in the tv show [Futurama]. Having created a robot Santa to carry out the work of a real Santa, an error in his programming causes him to judge that everyone is naughty. [Xmas] is therefore a holiday of fear, where all hide from Robot Santa as he tries to kill everyone he finds on [xmas] day.
		Example: The xmas song! (to the tune of [Santa Clause] is coming to town)
		He Knows when you are sleeping
		He knows when you're [on the can]
		He'll hunt you down and blast you're ass from here to Pakistan!
		You Better not move you better not move
		You're better off dead, I'm telling you dude
		Santa Clause is [gunning] you down!
		
		merry xmas everybody!!!

	(2004-12-31 +386/-235)
	It just means Christmas. It's easier to write if you put an X. No one is trying to take [the precious] CHRIST out of Christmas. For God's sake, lighten up. Your [religion's] not going to die because we say [Xmas] instead of Christmas.
		Example: "Merry [Xmas], Mr. SupersensitiveChristian."
		
		"[Get out of my house], [Devilchild]."

	(2004-11-22 +84/-93)
	Shortened form of Christmas. Some will tell you that this abbreviation "takes the Christ out of Christmas" but you should not listen to these people since they are probably [right-wing] [zealots] who will try to [convert] you.
		Example: [Xmas] makes [poor kids] cry when they realize [the rich] kids get all the good toys, all the good clothes, and all the good cars.

	(2005-03-28 +49/-53)
	Abbreviated form of Christmas. The letter "X" was used by ancient Christians under [persecution] as a sign of their faith, being a physical representation of the cross. Underground meeting spots usually had an "X" marked on the sidewalk in front. Since celebrating Christmas was illegal and could result in [martyrdom], [Xmas] was an acceptable name for the holiday.
		Example: Some super-conservative Christians are so uneducated on their [faith's] history that you wonder how they can [have the balls] to persecute others based on spelling, i.e., [X-mas].

	(2010-12-26 +11/-14)
	a shorter version of the word Christmas . criticized [for it's] [shortness] and the removal of the word Christ . using it when a [priest] is around is not recommended .
		Example: uncool Frank : this [Xmas] will be [bitchin'] .
		
		Peter the [uptight] catholic : May the Lord murder you and your family , my son .

	(2004-12-01 +36/-154)
	Word that [overly sensitive] [non-Christian] people use to take the prefix "Christ" out of Christmas. That would be like Christians referring to [Hanukkah] as x-ukkah, or saying x-dha instead of Buddha. It's pretty stupid and people should just use the correct term. No one says you have to believe in order to write or pronounce an important holiday for a certian group of people correctly.
		Example: You're invited to an [x-mas] party at my place in mid-town. 
		how about...
		You're invited to a [Christams] party at my place in mid-town.
		or better yet..
		You're invited to a [holiday party] at my place..

	(2005-12-19 +27/-166)
	what non religious "christians" celebrate. People who are only in it for the presents celebrate xmas. Real christians celebrate christmas. Christmas is for christian people. Everyone who celebrates xmas is a holiday [stealer], because they don't even understand christmas and they're [stealing it] from [the christian] people.
		Example: -Christmas is my favorite holiday!
		[-U] don't [celebrate] you stupid holiday [stealer]! U celebrate xmas.

	(2007-01-22 +16/-136)
	A term used to [x out] [christ]. To take christ out of christmas and [stomp] on him.
	
	A way to show that you are a non beleiver.
		Example: "merry xmas ya'll, come back to the trailer park any time. Ya'll cleaned the [single wide] up [real nice]."
		
		[no offence] to those who live in manufactured homes

Xmax
	(2008-02-17 +2725/-10019)
	Xmax is a bit like Christmas, but not religious. It is the [Xtreme] version of [Xmas] and is way cooler.
	It is possible to celebrate Xmax inadvertantly, so if you're having quite a lot of fun at Xmas and [nobody's] talking about the baby Jesus, then you're probably celebrating Xmax. Don't worry tho, Xmax is much better.
		Example: "I can't [believe it's] [December 25th] again so quickly"
		
		"Yeh, I know. Thanks for this amazing present by the way, it's much better than any [Xmas] present i've had before!"
		
		"That's cos it's an Xmax present dude! Merry Xmax"

XML
	(2004-03-14 +132/-33)
	Well it's not a programming language at all actually. XML stand for eXtensible [Markup] Language. 
	
	[w3c].org: {
	Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple, very flexible text format derived from SGML ([ISO] 8879). Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web and elsewhere. 
	}
	
	it can get pretty complicated, but the basics are simple enough and a decent way to bypass alot of cross-tech crap that you get when you can't stand using Microsoft's suite of crap because you can't stand reading their [deplorable] documentation.
		Example: <[DICTIONARY]> 
		... 
		<[ENTRY word]="XML" isNoun="YES"> 
		<DEFINITION> 
		see above 
		</DEFINITION> 
		</[ENTRY]>
		...
		</DICTIONARY>

	(2005-08-13 +33/-106)
	[Short] for [Examine] my [labia]
		Example: The [gynecologist] likes to XML. 
		I could tell from the [semi] [bulging] from his pants.

	(2003-10-16 +15/-13)
	Recent variant of HTML;[Hypertext] [Markup] Language.
	
	[XML] is useful in short documentations and other odd works that don't matter.
		Example: 

	(2006-02-25 +29/-9)
	An [XML] Molester is any programmer who believes that he must learn the structure of [Visual Studio] XML config files; files that are automatically generated and automatically managed by Visual Studio.NET.  XML Molesters compulsively memorize the tag structure of SOAP messages, and practice writing XML data sets (XSD files) by hand using notepad.  They often enjoy embarrassing seasoned pros over their apparent lack of XML knowledge and skill.
	
	XML Molestation is considered a profound [psycho-sexual] pathology by most [healthy, wealthy, and wise] Visual Studio programmers.  Like a Peeping Tom, XML Molesters feel a desperate and uncontrollable need to peek under Visual Studio‚Äôs panties to get a gander at what the lady really looks like on the inside.  What they don‚Äôt understand is that such crass anatomical knowledge of Visual Studio‚Äôs private parts is not necessary for a productive business relationship with the lady.  Indeed, it is usually counter productive.  XML Molestation can lead to major project corruption, as Visual Studio.NET can become quite angry when you poke her in the nether regions, and chew your project up.
	
		Example: Ron of IT Professionals Inc. is a real [XML molester].  I heard him [interviewing] a 10 year veteran programmer the other day.  He chewed this guy a new one because he couldn't explain [XML] tag structure of SOAP envelope, and a web.config file.

They are often criticised by non-users, but the Xsado riders have been giving the brand [nothing but thumbs] up.

	(2007-10-09 +44/-278)
	WHAT "[XTIAN]" IS NOT...
	"[Xtian]" is NOT a [shorted] version of a believer &/or follower of Jesus Christ. Unlike the term "Xmas" which is offensive to many Christians (taking Christ out of Christmas), "Xtian" has a totally different meaning.
	
	WHAT A "XTIAN" IS...
	"Xtian" is term to describe people who are radical followers of Jesus Christ in word, thought and deed (they actually obey the bible and are humble & [repentant] about their sin & failings before a perfect & [holy God]; their lives center around [repentance] & obedience to God). It describes those who have & are still being conformed to the image of Jesus Christ.
	
	DEFINITION:
	Here is how the word "Xtian" breaks down...
	
	1). the "X" in Latin is defined as 'To delete, cancel, or obliterate' (i.e. kill, crush & [crucify]). 
	
	2). the "[tian]" in Latin means 'to hold, grasp, have'. 
	
	So an "Xtian" is a believer who dies to self (gives up everything they hold & have), thru the power of Jesus Christ    and radically conforms to His image; a servant/[bondservant] of Christ. Not by their own power but by submitting everything in their lives to Christ (even if they have to die), for His glory.
	
	For more explanation about dying to self & conforming tho His image, watch the youtube video entitled "Get Your Cup SO Full of JESUS that Nothing Else Can Fit!" by fotm1.
	
	SCRIPTURE REFERENCES:

	4. [Romans] 12:1-3
	"Therefore I urge you, brethren, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living and holy sacrifice, acceptable to God, which is your spiritual service of worship. And do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, so that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and acceptable and perfect. For through the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think; but to think so as to have sound judgment, as God has allotted to each a measure of faith."

	Its all about His glory & being a servant (totally sold out & obedient) to the Living, Almighty God / [Jehovah] [24/7/365].
	
		Example: "[Yea that] guy is a real "Xtian" 24/7... he's not one of those "sunday [christians] (poser, [hypocrite], etc)"."

	(2010-09-02 +29/-77)
	[Amateur radio] ([ham radio]) [morse code] abbreviation for wife.
	
	Hams call any (assumed) single female ham radio operator a [YL] or "young lady". A ham radio [operator's] wife is often called an [XYL] or "ex-young lady" even if she is a ham. Male operators are always called OM or "old man". There is an obvious double standard for women.
	
	It's impossible to tell whether a person sending morse code is a man or a woman. Still, it was the custom for a long time to greet any operator on morse code as OM. Thankfully that custom is dying out. Now no gender assumption is made.
	
	Some women ham radio operators find XYL offensive. These operators prefer that hams refer to all women as [YLs]. The term XYL is still used frequently on the air however. Perhaps this is because the vast majority of ham radio operators are men and apathetic about the feelings of women operators.
	
	I agree with women operators that advocate for the universal use of YL especially since it is no longer customary to greet every ham on morse with OM. The universal use of YL also removes a double standard.
		Example: I am a ham radio operator that calls all women [YLs] on the air. I think [XYL] is [anachronistic].

XYZZY
	(2003-07-02 +200/-68)
	The quintessential [magic word], originally from the "[ADVENT]" text-adventure game. The word XYZZY would [teleport] the player when spoken in the right location.
		Example: (From ADVENTURE)
		>You are in a room filled with [debris] washed in from the surface. A low wide passage with [cobbles] becomes plugged with mud and debris here, but an awkward canyon leads upward and west.  A note on the wall says "[MAGIC WORD] XYZZY".

	(2005-01-23 +72/-25)
	from the [ADVENT] game The [canonical] `magic word'. This comes from ADVENT, in which the idea is to explore an underground cave with many rooms and to collect the treasures you find there. If you type `xyzzy' at the appropriate time, you can move instantly between two otherwise distant points. If, therefore, you encounter some bit of magic, you might remark on this quite [succinctly] by saying simply "[Xyzzy]!" "Ordinarily you can't look at someone else's screen if he has protected it, but if you type quadruple-bucky-clear the system will let you do it anyway." "Xyzzy!" 
	
	Xyzzy has actually been implemented as an undocumented [no-op] command on several OSes; in Data [General's] [AOS]/VS, for example, it would typically respond "Nothing happens", just as ADVENT did if the magic was invoked at the wrong spot or before a player had performed the action that enabled the word. In more recent 32-bit versions, by the way, AOS/VS responds "Twice as much happens".
		Example: The popular `minesweeper' [game under] [Microsoft Windows] has a cheat mode triggered by the command `xyzzy<enter><right-shift>' that turns the top-left pixel of the screen different colors depending on whether or not the [cursor] is over a bomb.
