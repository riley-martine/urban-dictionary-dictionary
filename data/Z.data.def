	Day Z is a first/third person [zombie survival] mod for the PC game "[ArmA] 2". It is also being released in standalone form as well.
	
	It is an MMO game, with rival players, NPCs, maps, and servers.
	It is somewhat unique in the fact that players only get one life; dying respawns the player at a random location with no weapons or equipment.
	
	This makes in-game death very undesirable and highly [consequential] with a loss of all progress. The game features a unique system for health (blood points) which can be restored by eating certain foods or receiving blood transfusions. Weapons and ammo are limited, as are vehicle spawns. Players must [scavenge] for equipment (i.e. [navigation], medical, and storage items), that will help them survive as they search food and water. Players can gain "humanity" by doing good deeds (example: giving blood transfusions), and lose "humanity" by doing "evil" deeds (killing [unarmed] players). Players with a lack of "humanity" points take on the appearance of bandits, where as players with a good deal of "humanity" points take on the appearance of a "hero". The website for the Day Z mod claims the average life expectancy is one hour, nine minutes.
		Example: "Hey man, gonna place some Day Z tonight?"
		"I [dono] dude...that game is hard! I got jumped by a [bandit] and a zombie and lost my gear!"
		"It's all good! I've got extra gear to share!"
		
		"Dude have you seen [Frankie's] latest video? He headshots a bandit at 900 meters!"

	(2004-12-27 +1048/-570)
	Facts/non-opinionated, accumilative definitions:
	
	Jay-Z was a hip-hop artist in the 1990's. Jay-Z was pseudonym for [Sean Carter], dirivative of his New York childhood nickname, Jazzy. 
	
	Jay-Z, over the period of his career in hip-hop, was very successful, and had a slew of hits, such as "Can I Get A..." "Big Pimpin" and "[Hard Knock Life]". Jay-Z's debut album "[Reasonable Doubt]" did not receive much success, but much acclaim for those who found the album. His later work was geered more towards a pop-oriented crowd, however, they became more and more successful. His "Blueprint" album was seen as his masterpiece, but not quite topping "Reasonable Doubt". Jay-Z and mogul [Damon Dash] started [Rocafella] records. He announced his retirement in early 2004 and "The Black Album" was his last album. 
	
	During Jay's career, he engaged in a feud or "beef" with another popular rap artist named Nas. Both MC's were considered applicable opponents for each other, unlike many beefs, and there would be no clear victor if they were to ever MC battle. Many people decided to take sides on this fight, while many stayed neutral.
	
	This posters opinion:
	
	I like Jay-Z. Though I always like the hip-hop stylings of Public Enemy, Run D.M.C, A Tribe Called Quest, and the Beastie Boys better, I still have an amount of respect for him being a known pop-oriented rapper and still making good albums and keeping a certain amount of [street credibility]. As for what side I take on the feud, I'm going to go with Jay. Though I do thoroughly enjoy Nas and his "Illmatic", I feel that Jay just made better albums than Nas, which is a factor which is very important to me.
		Example: "A good example of [hip-hop's] influence on [pop music] in [the 1990's] would be Jay-Z"

	(2005-02-11 +4059/-2360)
	Pretty much everyone who has written a definition for Jay is a fucking idiot. Jay-Z is one of the most lyrically brilliant rappers in raps short history. Thats not arguable its a fact. It is true that he began to commercialize his rap after his outstanding debut album [Reasonable Doubt] (one of the best rap albums in history) and that was unfortunate, but he turned it around with [the Blueprint] which was a great album and [Blueprint] 2 and [Black Album] were also very good. If I see one more person write that Jay-Z is fake or is a pussy im gonna go fucking insane. The beauty of [the Jay-Z] vs. Nas battle was that they are both lyrically brilliant, they both have lived what they say and are straight from some of the most infamous housing projects, or "hoods" in New York City and every accusation they made about eachother being fake was a lie. Jay-Z and Biggie Smalls were like fucking best friends (besides Puff) so of course they are gonna take some bars from eachother. Wait, who was in the two best collaborations Notorious B.I.G has ever done? Oh yeah - Jay-Z ([Brooklyns] Finest, I Love the Dough). Hes fake even though he was a huge drug dealer, and stabbed a guy just for leaking bootlegs of his album into the street (OH HE FUCKING FAKED THAT, OK THATS A FUCKING SMART THING TO SAY CONSIDERING THAT LANCE [RIVERA] MADE A PUBLIC STATEMENT THAT HE SAW JAY WALK OVER TO HIM IN THE CLUB AND STAB HIM). If he was that fake and that much of a pussy would "The Game" throw positive lines at him in pretty much everyone of his songs and describe him as a legend? Just because he fucking makes songs that the [mainstream pop] audience likes doesnt mean hes a motherfucking fake and anyone who knows anything about Rap and its history knows that, if u disagree your a fucking moron and u shouldnt be allowed to listen to rap music.
		Example: "I'm not a biter I'm a writer for myself and others
		I say a B.I.G. verse, I'm only [biggin] up my brother
		[Biggin] up my borough, I'm big enough to do it
		I'm that thorough" --- Very True
		
		DOWNLOAD THE 7 MINUTE FREESTYLE HE DID WITH BIG L AND THEN SAY HES NOT A GOOD RAPPER
		
		also buy [Reasonable Doubt] and realize its one of the best rap albums ever made, better then Illmatic (barely)

It rose to popularity from cartoon networks largely edited adaptation in the early 2000s.  Some people criticize it because of the [anime's] large amounts of filler, which would slow down the pace of the series dramatically.  However, the manga was extremely concise.  in fact, 3 anime episodes were sometimes adapted from a single manga issue.  Many critics do not understand this, resulting in large amounts of criticizm and hatred.  In America it became the first taste of Anime for some people, and therefore can be considered a [groundbreaking] anime here.  
		Example: Dragon Ball Z is hated by some people, however, many [gripes] about the [series] are [superfluous] in the face of a well made series.

	These [preteens] cannot type their insults toward possible DBZ-haters properly without adding random misspelled cusswords when trying to defend how a fighting anime can run for about fifty episodes before someone enrages themselves with power so much that it's surprising that someone doesn't explode from their muscles overtaking their head.
		Example: "Oh my god the veins on that guy! He must be on [steriods]...and...drugs from [flying around] when he's...[glowy]? What the hell is this show?"

[Although I'll admit, I like GT a bit better] But still a good show all the same.

		1963- 36.5gal fuel tank, special heavy-duty suspension, aluminum brake drums (w/ metallic linings), brake cooling ducts, close-ratio 4-speed transmission, high-performance bias-ply tires on 15" alloy wheels

	(2006-04-27 +77/-46)
	Affordable US sportscar; great performance though it lacks the refinement of what it's trying to compete with.  Features an hand built all-aluminum OHV 7.0L LS7 small block producing 505 HP @ 6300 RPM and 470 lb-ft of TQ @ 4800 RPM with a redline of 7000 RPM.  The powerplant is hooked to a close-ratio 6 speed  rear transaxle.  It weighs in at around 3130 lbs and the chassis is made of hydroformed aluminum and magnesium.  The body is made of composites and carbon fiber.  It features fully independent suspension consisting of double [wishbones] on all four corners, dampeners, anti-roll bars, and two transverse single ply [leaf springs] instead of coil springs.  The use of leaf springs in the Corvette is not to be confused with leaf spring suspensions used in trucks and older cars; they are two completely different things.  The Corvettes [transverse leaf springs] serve the same purpose as coil springs in other vehicles, but they are lighter, allow for the vehicles mass to be closer to the ground, and allow for lighter anti-roll bars since they can assume some of that duty.  They're main disadvantage is that they are more expensive than coil springs.
	
	The Z06 offers very impressive performance for it's price; it's track times are on par with some of the greatest production performance cars in the world 
		Example: The new [C6 Z06] [Corvette] may lack the refinement of its European competition but on the track it can give them [a run] for their money.

		Example: the [z06] corvette engine doesn’t produce 100 hp per liter because it have some thing that other engine doesn’t have and that it torque. Could any body here show me an engine that have 100hp per liter and not be force induction and produce [386] pounds of torque at 1500 rpm like the [ls7] do? Or could any body here could tell me what other car with [500hp] could get 16/26 [mpg] and don’t pay a gas [guzzler] tax like z06?   Yeah I know impressive and all of that form what people say it “old tech” .

Just like Hondas and other imports.
		Example: A [cold air intake] on an import might make an extra 5-6HP, but on a V8 it's 15-20 HP. The exhuast systems on imports around 10-15. On V8s it is 25-30 HP. Just face it, the fastest import will loose to the fastest American V8. Also Cadilact has a prototype [V16] that has 1,000HP on [pump gas]. Name a proto type import that can match that? You can't!!! Imports a garbage. If you like them so much move to Japan. Heh, maybey Japanese people like American cars becuase they are faster.

	Although the Z06 has a powerful V8 engine and a sleek chassis, it still fails to accomplish the efficiency and the agility of many European or Japanese imports. The Chevrolet powerhouse has yet to produce 100 horsepowers for every liter of its gigantic 7.0 liter engine.
	
	Track performance seekers who are not biased regarding the country of origin of their car may consider a cheaper yet equally well performing Japanese import such as the [Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution] MR or the Subaru Impreza WRX STi.

	(2006-04-27 +77/-46)
	Affordable US sportscar; great performance though it lacks the refinement of what it's trying to compete with.  Features an hand built all-aluminum OHV 7.0L LS7 small block producing 505 HP @ 6300 RPM and 470 lb-ft of TQ @ 4800 RPM with a redline of 7000 RPM.  The powerplant is hooked to a close-ratio 6 speed  rear transaxle.  It weighs in at around 3130 lbs and the chassis is made of hydroformed aluminum and magnesium.  The body is made of composites and carbon fiber.  It features fully independent suspension consisting of double [wishbones] on all four corners, dampeners, anti-roll bars, and two transverse single ply [leaf springs] instead of coil springs.  The use of leaf springs in the Corvette is not to be confused with leaf spring suspensions used in trucks and older cars; they are two completely different things.  The Corvettes [transverse leaf springs] serve the same purpose as coil springs in other vehicles, but they are lighter, allow for the vehicles mass to be closer to the ground, and allow for lighter anti-roll bars since they can assume some of that duty.  They're main disadvantage is that they are more expensive than coil springs.
	
	The Z06 offers very impressive performance for it's price; it's track times are on par with some of the greatest production performance cars in the world 
		Example: The new [C6 Z06] [Corvette] may lack the refinement of its European competition but on the track it can give them [a run] for their money.
		
		Only rich snobs that aren't true auto enthusiasts would insult the new C6 Z06.

	427ci monster that cost 65k and  [run with] [cars 3] and [4 time] it price. It is fast at ¼ and in the track. Second fastest car at the n-ring.
		Example: the [z06] corvette engine doesn’t produce 100 hp per liter because it have some thing that other engine doesn’t have and that it torque. Could any body here show me an engine that have 100hp per liter and not be force induction and produce [386] pounds of torque at 1500 rpm like the [ls7] do? Or could any body here could tell me what other car with [500hp] could get 16/26 [mpg] and don’t pay a gas [guzzler] tax like z06?   Yeah I know impressive and all of that form what people say it “old tech” .

	(2004-01-08 +96/-134)
	A very fast american sports car with 405HP Stock. You see this engine has 405HP Stock. Their is no Honda, Acura or any poorly made import that has 405HP stock. In fact they all are garbage. The [Z06 Corvette] is a very fast car that will smoke [imports]. Just face it, imports are garbage. Sure you can make a [Geo Metro] run 7s on a quater mile, but it is still a garbage car. Just like Hondas and other imports.
		Example: A [cold air intake] on an import might make an extra 5-6HP, but on a V8 it's 15-20 HP. The exhuast systems on imports around 10-15. On V8s it is 25-30 HP. Just face it, the fastest import will loose to the fastest American V8. Also Cadilact has a prototype [V16] that has 1,000HP on [pump gas]. Name a proto type import that can match that? You can't!!! Imports a garbage. If you like them so much move to Japan. Heh, maybey Japanese people like American cars becuase they are faster.

However he was only rated a 6 out of 10 for his "hotness" on the show "Are you HOT or NOT" for his girly appearance and skinny-legs. Along with his fast rise to fame, Zac Efron made many enemies.

Zach Condon
	(2009-06-16 +86/-12)
	The [wunderkind] founder of the band, Beirut. Zach [Condon] is both brilliant extremely hot. Condon started producing his own music at age 15 in the Albequerque bedroom of his parents house. Since then, he dropped out of school at 16 and traveled Europe with his older brother, which was where he was introduced to music of The Konaci Orkestar and also Balkan Folk music. His first (unofficial) album The Joys of Losing Weight (which he produced under the name "Realpeople") was never released and is only available through downloads online.
	
	Since then, the 24 year old has went on to create two full length albums, including, Gulag Orkestar and The Flying Club Cup. He has also finished three EP's: [Elephant Gun],Lon Gisland, and Pompeii and in addition one double EP, March of The Zapotec & Realpeople: Holland. Condon recorded part one of the EP, March of The Zapotec, with a [Mexican funeral] band in [Oaxaca], Mexico. He later recorded the second part in his bedroom under the moniker, "Realpeople".
	
	Condon believes it is very important to keep the two projects, Beirut and Realpeople, seperate from each other as they have two very different sounds. Realpeople has more of a techno feel as opposed to [Beirut's] [full brass band] sound.
	
	Condon plays countless instruments, guitar not included. When he was fourteen he broke his wrist falling of a bridge into a dry riverbed and later had surgery on it when he was seventeen. Because of this, one of his wrists is 1 & 1/2 inches shorter and, also a considerable amount less flexible than the other which makes it nearly impossible for Condon to reach his wrist around the neck of a guitar. However, Condon doesn't see this as a set back. Instead he substitutes guitar with ukelele and other instruments.
	
	[Zach Condon's] Marital Status:
	Sorry ladies and gents but Condon is definitely taken by [Kristianna] Smith. Whether he is married to her, remains uncertain but in several interviews he is wearing a gold wedding band on his left ring finger.

Zack Snyder
	(2021-04-28 +97/-11)
	The ultimate comic book [movie director]. Suffers from major spinal problems for singlehandedly carrying the entire [DCEU] on his fucking back. Responsible for many brilliant and well plotted adaptations of comic characters. Zack Snyder is loved by all who favor movies with substance, characters given actuality, and a well piloted plot. And he is hated by people who can't handle movies that require actual logic and reasoning..
	
	With the release of ZSJL, Zack Snyder as a verb means to [make a movie] or anything more epic. To give it value, meaning and soul.
		Example: "Dragon Age 2 writer reveals everything he would fix about [Bioware] 's Divisive Sequel."
		"If you could Zack Snyder DA2, what would you change?"
		
		...
		
		Guy 1: "Man, [the reboot] of that new superhero movie was so good. So much better than the original."
		Guy 2: "Yup, agreed. They totally [Zack Snyder'd] the reboot."

	(2019-01-08 +201/-49)

Also did a remake of [George A. Romero's] Dawn of the Dead, a weird owl movie I haven't seen, and wrote an original screenplay that sucked.
	
	Zack Snyder has a vision, executes the vision, and doesn't give a single fuck what you think about it.
		Example: [Normie]: “Wanna go see the new [Avengers] movie?"
		Intellectual: "No thanks, I'd rather stay home and watch true [kino]. Like a Zack Snyder film"

	The definition of a philosophical and enlightened director. Zack Snyder is responsible for creating the most innovative and thought provoking films known to men. His realistic, religious, and philosophical movies are too much for the average person to [decipher]. Most people have been accustomed to the bland, [unimaginative], basic, and low risk [MCU], and whenever someone tries to make something that is smarter than the norm (like Zack himself has done), they will throw a temper tantrum and take a scene completely out of context in order to satisfy their ego and boost their bullshit narrative. Most people are either too ignorant or too afraid to admit Zack and the [DCEU's] superiority to the MCU.
		Example: [MCU] [Fanboy]: "The Martha scene made no sense, why would anyone become friends because there moms have the same name?"
		[DCEU] Fanboy: "Have you considered the fact that maybe the meaning to the scene was that after Superman said 'Save Martha', Batman realized that Superman was more human than he thought (because he has a human mom), and that Batman himself had become the thing he fought against (a monster that kills people)? Have you also considered that they became allies instead of friends?"
		MCU Fanboy: "B-But Batman told Martha that they were friends!"
		DCEU Fanboy: "Maybe because he wanted her to trust him?"
		MCU Fanboy "..."
		MCU Fanboy: "But Zack Snyder is just an idiot who ruined the DCEU!"
		DCEU Fanboy "Or maybe you're too ignorant to at least try and understand [the messages] he tries to convey."
		MCU Fanboy: "Don't talk to me, I'm just going to watch [the Infinity] Wars trailer for the 34th time!"

	(2011-04-03 +80/-210)
	[Anytime] a person tells an [elaborate] story with no point or [plot] what so ever.

zanbato
	(2006-06-01 +212/-34)
	An incredibly large sword forged during the Edo period of [Japanese history]. Although it was originally meant to take down a horse and its rider in one swing, the weapon was so massive that it required at least two people to hold, much less wield. In the Japanese manga Rurouni Kenshin, fighting enthusiast Sagura [Sanosuke], under the name 'Zanza', carried and fought with a zanbato, belying his incredible strength. [Sanosuke's] zanbato had no edge, due to its age; so although it was formally called a blade, it could only be used to smash and crush.
		Example: [Hah]! A zanbato? You'd have more luck finding one in a [museum] than in a shop anywhere [in Japan]!

	(2005-03-01 +207/-51)
	A sword [forged] during the [Edo] Period. It was incredibly large and mainly used for taking out riders on horses. Because it was so large and heavy, not one could [wield] very good.
		Example: [Sanosuke] used a zanbato in the 4th/[5th] episode of [Rurouni Kenshin].

	(2009-12-04 +1110/-301)
	A [Zanbato] (literally "horse-slaying sword" or "horse-chopping saber") is an especially large type of Japanese sword, the historical use of which is disputed. The sword closely resembles the [nodachi] or [odachi], however it differs from the nodachi by having a ricasso of approximately 12 to 18 inches ([460] mm). This lends more to the theory of the sword having a practical use in feudal Japan. The increased length of the blade, along with the extra grip, would give it dual use both as a sword and as a [polearm] for attacking advancing cavalry. This style of [zanbato] sword can be found for sale in rural tourist shops and stands in [Kyoto] and [Nara] prefectures of Japan. This sword may have been inspired by the Chinese [zhan] ma [dao] as both were said to have been used for killing the horse and rider in one swing. It is likely that the zanbato is actually a mis-construction of the [zh]ǎn mǎ dāo, poorly drawn or translated by Japanese travellers who witnessed the weapon being used during battle.
		Example: Such extremely long and curved zabatao swords did exist, and were solely used for ceremonial purposes. Experienced [smiths] often took upon themselves to prove their talent by creating these so-called "[zanbato]" as a way to challenge themselves. This led to the extremely long [blades] often seen in ancient depictions, some of which were so long (over a dozen feet long) that they could hardly be mistaken for something other than display pieces.

	[Zani] زاني and [zania] زانية in Arabic (and perhaps Hebrew too) are an adjective (descriptive word) for a man and a woman simultaneously. This adjective comes from the verb zana (past) and [yazna] (present), zi'na (noun), 'zani (the man who is a fornicator), 'zania (a woman who is a fornicator), [zanoon] (a group of fornicators), zoonat (as previous). Thus, in the dictionary, it means fornicate outside marriage. Therefore [zani] and zania both mean promiscuous, adulterous man or woman. [Zania] is an adulterous woman who has [no honour] and no values. She is promiscuous and ungodly. This adjective is not used as a name in the Middle east because it is an insult. However, it is often mistaken with the name Zin (handsome) and Zina (or [Zeena]) which means beautiful. The two words pronounce very differently indeed.
	These adjectives were mentioned tens of times in the Quran, especially in Sourat Al-Nur and Al-Furkan.
		Example: Surat Al-Nur (24) [Ayat] 3: The male adulterous ([zani]) will only make love to a female adulterous ([zania]) or a non-believer and vice versa, and this was forbidden for believers.
		الزَّانِي لَا يَنْكِحُ إِلَّا زَانِيَةً أَوْ مُشْرِكَةً وَالزَّانِيَةُ لَا يَنْكِحُهَا إِلَّا زَانٍ أَوْ مُشْرِكٌ ۚ وَحُرِّمَ ذَٰلِكَ عَلَى الْمُؤْمِنِينَ

	A great [christian band].  It is often a subject of debate of which genre they belong in, which would depend on which vocalist you are talking about.  Zao has had, if I am not mistaken, 4 vocalists. I dont't know the name of their original vocalist but the 2nd was Shawn Jonas, then Daniel Weyandt(current voaclist), then for a while Dan left and they had Corey [Darst] for touring and demos.  They used to be hardcore, but with vocalist Dan Weyandt it is now closer to MetalCore/Grindcore/Death Metal-whatever you call it, it's some good shit.  Some people say they arent christian anymore, but they still are.  Up until their most recent release, The Funeral of God, they were on [christian hardcore] label Solid State. Their 2002 album, "Parade of Chaos", was said to be their final release, but of course that wasn't true.  The Funeral of God, which was released [July 13], 2004 on Ferret Music in the US/Canada amd July 12, 2004 on [Roadrunner Records] in Europe, has some of the most excellent and vivid lyrics ever.  Zao also has no original memeber, which i guess means they arent the same band, but the lineup changes happened so gradually they still seem to be Zao.  They also sound very similar to Carcass.  And don't skip on them because they are christian theyre fucking awesome!
		Example: Former [vocalist] of Zao Shawn [Jonas] has an excellent band called [Symphony In Peril].

	Regarding the Chrisian band called Zao, they took [that word] as their name for this reason, that they are born-again Christians (at least all the original members were). [The album] "Alive is Dead" was meant to be their final album, and the name has the hidden meaning. Literally, Zao is dead.
		Example: He [cried] out to God for [salvation] and he recieved [zao].

Zarathustra
	(2010-11-09 +54/-18)
	Zarathustra was a Aryan prophet, he lived among the Indo-Aryans in the Eurasian steppes in [1450] BC, during a period known as the Bronze Age, where the the people worshiped pagan gods such as Mithra, the goddess of light. Then Zarathustra introduced a concept known [Ahura Mazda], a Wise Being who live only according to his or her own wisdom and morality. Friedrich Nietzsche understood this introduced the [Overman] in Thus Spoke Zarathustra or "SuperHuman" in German, which is a person who breaks away from the herd mentality and lives by his or her "[will to power]". The SuperHuman is achieved through the six [Amesha] Spentas. We must understand Zarathustra was not a leader instead he was a guiding people to follow their own wisdom. Zarathustra was the pioneers of humanism but most of his true philosophy went into decline after the Greek invasion of Persia, and the introduction of personification of Greek gods to the Persians.
		Example: Zarathustra"
		Certainly I shall acquire
		The Human Wisdom ([Mazda] [Ahura])
		Through Good use of the Mind
		I shall master them all
		Physical and that of the mind (mental)
		Gaining through Knowledge
		Whereby desiring and achieving [righteousness] and perfection"

	(2016-07-09 +20/-6)
	A philosophical novel by Friedrich [Nietzsche] written in the 19th century. In German it is titled: Also sprach [Zarathustra]. In English, it is also called "Thus Spoke Zarathustra".
	
	Or, simplified: Therefore, >> he (Zarathustra) spoke of >> thee. (subject)
	
	It is a book widely regarded as [Nietzsche's] best work.
	
	The title name Thus Spake Zarathustra, is meant to be ironic and cynical, like morbid sarcasm; and is suggestive of the apprehensive atmosphere the book displays. It explains why Zarathustra turned himself into a Prophet, during an era where [God is dead] (metaphor) in order to quell and stop disorder and confusion in the Middle East.
	
	Despite Nietzsche being a good person; It is a very dangerous book, that should only be read by mature and responsible individuals. (this is why Germany and Russia have attempted to ban books written by Nietzsche.)
	
	Basically, it tells the story of a real Avestan (Aryan) prophet named Zoroaster who lived about 2,500 years ago; and whom started a religion (see: [Zoroastrianism]) in order to overthrow a malignant, illegitimate and dystopian Empire; (see: Babylon) and to help [uproot] it, in order to create a new social order. Essentially, Zoroaster (or Zarathustra) attempts to become a Nobleman and wise prophet among the populace; or more specifically, an Übermensch.
		Example: Thus Spake Zarathustra is a very good read. (whether you are Atheist or believer) Only the most intellectual of individuals are able to truly comprehend and understand it. Assholes and cowards despise and [deride] it; or are just too lazy or daft. The average individual may not understand the book. Many critics of [Nietzsche] disdainfully [write it off] as nonsense and drivel. The book is basically written in a fairy-tale storybook way, kind of like a poem or poetic prose. (similar to the gospel).
		
		(Although asshole critics [overlook] and bash Nietzsche, he was actually doing perfectly fine in Mental health at the time, while he wrote the book. Nietzsche has a lot of controversy surrounding him; such as his subsequently [deteriorating] mental health. Which is what critics (without reading or understanding) overlook.)
		
		Those who "get the book" therefore "understand". This is why Nietzsche proclaimed and entitled the book with the famous cautionary slogan: "A BOOK FOR EVERYONE AND FOR NO ONE."
		
		(it could be said by some scholars, that mortal Zoroaster was the original Jesus.)
		
		Ex. In Thus Spake Zarathustra; humble Zoroaster, minding the war, chaos and disorder that surrounds him; attempts to bring [back order] and self-responsibility to the people; and becomes an Übermensch, [respite] risking his own life.

Zennial
	(2020-07-18 +253/-144)
	People born in the years of 1995-2001. They share characteristics of both millennials and [generation Z].
	
	1995 borns were the first to graduate in a year ending with -teen and 2001 borns are going to be the last. Class of 2002-2012 = solidly Y, class of 20teen = [zennial], class of 202X = solidly Z. i think this works pretty well because 1995 borns aren’t ancient or anything, they’ll be part of the 18-24 demographic until 2020, meaning they have been/will be spending a decent amount of their [young adulthood] within Z culture.
		Example: I’m a [zennial]; I have the best traits of both [millennials] and [generation Z].

	(2019-12-10 +231/-226)
	Zennials are those of us born in the micro-generation occurring between 1992 and 1998 – in the [blurring] of time that manifested itself between the Millennials (roughly 1980/81/82 to 1994/95/96) and Generation Z (roughly 1995/96/97 to 2010/11/12).
	
	There has been a lot of debate as to whether the last [cutoff] year for Millennial Gen is 1994 (as some start the 15 year Millennial gen in 1980), 1995 (my preferred cutoff and cited on Urban Dictionary a lot), or 1996 (now becoming more popular as the [cut-off] date as the generations mature and [congeal]). Therefore, to arrive at the Zennial micro-gen years, [take the middle] of those 3 years (1995) and extend it 3 years before (1992), and then 3 years after (1998).
	
	Some of us remember 9/11 clearly (the oldest Zennials were 9), others barely so (the youngest Zennials where 3 or nearly so) – but we all were raised with the consequences of our changed society afterwards.
	
	• On one side, we’re considered lazy. We don’t want to work in the real world, our shelves are lined with participation trophies and “activism” is a dirty word.
	• On the other side, we’re the new world saviour. We work hard with the technology that’s native to our lives and find that activism is the only way we know how to change the political and economic world.
	
	This [dichotomy] is the life of a Zennial. How can we save the world with fiery activism and technology while also being too lazy to [amount to much] of anything?
		Example: If you were still in single [digits] in terms of age when [9/11] happened, but also are [old enough] to remember it, even if somewhat hazily, then you are a Zennial.

	Zennials often have the same aspects of a young millennials childhood but also [grew up with] technology.

	Quite possibly the most determined Anime faction of all time.

[The faction] itself is basically the Nazis in space, with each new series trying to make it even more clear (Until the latest Gundam series, Gundam Unicorn which abandoned subtlety altogether and just gave their [giant robots] Nazi helmets and weaponry). Zeon began as a movement to liberate the space colonies from the rule of the Earth Federation and create an independent nation in space. However, their rulers read a little bit too much of 'Mein Kampf' and decided to go on sprees of what many of us refer to as 'War Crimes', even going so far as to gas a colony full of civilians and then drop the thing onto the earth, resulting in a crater over [500 miles] wide. Then they did that a few more times. Point is, they like making things explode and their leaders tend not to have too strong a grasp on this whole 'Morality' thing everyone keeps going on about. Despite the fact that the producers keep trying to make them evil, the fanbase of Zeon seems to be larger than that of [the federation]. More than likely this is because they always get the cool toys and tend to have more badass characters. Like Char, the Red Comet who manages to be one of Anime's most memorable villains.

If you ever end up in Zephyrhills, save your ass and get out! Go to Tampa, it's better.

zerbert
	(2010-03-18 +130/-37)
	The other definitions have the right meaning (a [sloppy kiss] where you blow, making a farting sound,) but this spelling and pronunciation have diverged from the original, and should be considered incorrect.
	
	This word was first introduced on "[The Cosby] Show", (Season 2, Episode 11) and explicitly spelled out "[ZRBTT]". It was also clearly pronounced without the final "r" sound given here. It was spelled repeatedly by several characters. The subtitles as aired on the show spelled it "Zurbitt" when Bill Cosby was pronouncing it as if it were a real word. Part of the joke of this word is that it's a nonsense spelling without vowels.
	
	In the episode, Vanessa was practicing for a [spelling test], and [Rudy] kept interrupting, asking what a series of nonsense letters spelled. The following, including spelling, is taken from the subtitles as transmitted.
		Example: Rudy: Vanessa, what does "Q-N-G-H" spell?
		
		Vanessa: Nothing. Give me another word.
		
		Rudy: What does "Z-R-B-T-T" spell?
		
		Vanessa: Nothing!
		
		Rudy: How come when you [spell it's] a word and when I spell it it's nothing?
		
		Vanessa: Dad, I'm studying very hard for the spelling test, and she keeps asking dumb questions.
		
		Cliff: I don't think anybody asks dumb questions. What's your problem?
		
		Rudy: What does "Z-R-B-T-T" spell?
		
		Cliff: "Z-R-B-T-T" spell? Uh... That's zurbitt. Zurbitt... uh.. You know what I think a zurbitt is? I just remembered. A zurbitt is this:
		
		(makes [zrbtt] on [Rudy's] cheek.)

	(2004-12-01 +297/-154)
	[Zerg] as a verb is often used in conjunction with rush.  The original use of the [wort] [zerg] was actually a specific tactic in the game of Starcraft to provide an early checkmate to an otherwise very balanced game of real time strategy.  It involved finding the enemy early, and sendign as many of the basic [Zergling] units into your enemies base.  The enemy would usually be able to beat off the first few waves of the lightly powered units, but at a cost to production.  Since the person playing the Zerg race would commit almost all of thier resources to building the [zerglings] rather than upgrading buildings and technology they would slowly be able to wear down the production of the enemy until they could no longer generate enough of an income to fund the war.  It is a tricky [gambit] because by putting all of your resources toward war early if the enemy is able to somehow form a defense you will find yourself at a serious disadvantage [mid game].  If a player on the opposing team knows that a [zerg rush] is coming or strongly suspects it they will build a defensive structure in their base.  When I played Starcraft we usually had a no-zerg rule because it  made the games less fun.  Either the zerg [rusher] won in the first few minutes, or the person who [deflected] the zerg rush would win shortly after.  By imposing a ten minute non-expansion [peace treaty] some of the best epic battles were fought.
	
	In MMORPG's a popular way to beat a battle is by using overwhelming numbers, and the term [zerging] was borrowed from starcraft to define this.  This can often accomplish a feat with minimal skill and or gear, however many games now take this into effect and design encounters so that after a certain threshhold of players it becomes more difficult to manage the encounter.  For example, a few well placed hidden pits around a boss that when someone falls into them it releases a wave of ravenous creatures against the raid.  In  this case having a hundred people almost completely ensures that some idiot will fall into the traps no matter how many times you tell everyone where they are and how not to fall into them.
	
	In other MMORPG's which are player vs player zerging is often seen when one team or player is playing so far above the other teams that the losing side finally builds up a force large enough to win purely by flesh count.  [DAOC] was a game where this occured often by placing barriers to PVP that forces could camp.  If the force camping the [bottleneck] into the frontiers was good then it would do one of two things.  1.  It could [demoralize] the enemy and shut down [RVR].  2. It would create a buildup of players behind the bottleneck that would eventuall form a zerg.
	
	Zergs were considered by some a [necessary evil] in DAOC, but many considered them a [design flaw] in the game.
		Example: Starcraft [zerging].
		Human Vs. [Zerg].
		Building [SCV] (harvester) units.
		Two [zerglings] (basic [zerg] fighter) attack before your first marine (basic human fighter) is built.  You may attack the zergings with your SCV units, and will likely kill them, but at a cost of the life of an SCV unit or two.  After a brief time you may get a marine or two built, but then six zerglings attack, and instead of attacking the marines they attack only the SCV units.  The zerglings are weak and die quickly but may take out another couple SCV units.  After another brief time the humans are trying to create more SCV units to boost production to a much needed level instead of creating more defenses when the next wave of 12 zerglings come in and decimate the remaining SCV units.  As expected within minutes the game is over when the humans are overrun with waves of zerglings who have never had a shortage of raw materials.
		
		EQ zerging:  We are going to [zerg rush] the Avatar of War.  - 30 minutes later the entire zone floor is covered in corpses, and the Avatar of War is standing above a hunred corpses like nothing ever happened.

zerg rush
	(2008-02-28 +364/-74)
	A common strategy where a player mass builds a many weak units as he can, then rushes the enemy base. Usually works best early in the game. Taken from Starcraft, where often [zerglings] (really cheap unit that can be built in large [droves] quickly) would be sent at the start of the game to kill everyone in the first [couple moments].
		Example: Zerg Player: Ah hahaha! I'm [zerg rushing]!
		[Protoss Player]: Oh no, my precious zealots are too expensive for me to buy more than one. I'm screwed.
		Terran Player: *Flys to [higher ground]* What a bunch of fags.

	(2005-05-05 +844/-212)
	A term used for a [swarming] attack, and/or winning a battle by throwing bodies and outnumbering an opponent.
	
	This term was derived off of a video game called [Starcraft] which had a tactic where you are able to rush opponents [by mass] producing zergs and rushing them
		Example: "Oh shit those bastards are [zerg rushing] us." 
		"All you [pussies] can do is [Zerg Rush]."

	(2005-12-15 +260/-63)
	The battle tactic when an immense group of poorly equiped or low -level players/minions/characters swarms a much smaller group of well-defended/[high-level] characters/players and defeats with sheer numbers.
	Originated from the game StarCraft, in which if timed correctly you could send a dozen [zerglings] (lowest-level soldier avalible) into [the enemy's] base before they could make defenses. Spread to include any battle tactic that involved massive amounts of zerglings to overwhelm the enemy's defense.
		Example: "The 2 dozen mid-20 level alliance just zerg-rushed the 60s attacking Darkshire."
		
		"Why bother wasting resources on Ultralisks when 4 dozen [zerglings] can rip a [Protoss] [base up] like tissue paper in a zerg rush?"

	(2006-08-12 +61/-45)
	A [quick attack] that comes from the game Starcraft. The race Zerg makes units quickly, so a "[Zerg Rush]" is a quick, weak attack, or an [underhand] technique. Also an interjection.
	Its not only used in SC, but other games and just a random computer thing to yell.
		Example: [Player] A: [Well crap], a [zerg rush]!

		Example: [Player]: [ZOMG] Zerg Rush!!!

	(2006-05-02 +33/-14)
	The [Zerg Rush]. A strategy originating from Starcraft used only by the unstrategic. The Zerg Rush consists of mass producing as many [Zerg] [Zerglings] or Hydralisks in the shortest amount of time possible and attacking your enemy before he has a chance to do the same to you.
	
	Also sometimes just used as Zerg.
	Can be adapted for use anywhere.
		Example: I was trying to build some bunkers but after 5 minutes he was ready with his [zerg rush]. [Cheap bastard].
		
		Ok, here's the strategy: I'll hand the ball off to you and everyone else [zerg] the shit out of them.

	(2004-12-01 +297/-154)
	[Zerg] as a verb is often used in conjunction with rush.  The original use of the [wort] [zerg] was actually a specific tactic in the game of Starcraft to provide an early checkmate to an otherwise very balanced game of real time strategy.  It involved finding the enemy early, and sendign as many of the basic [Zergling] units into your enemies base.  The enemy would usually be able to beat off the first few waves of the lightly powered units, but at a cost to production.  Since the person playing the Zerg race would commit almost all of thier resources to building the [zerglings] rather than upgrading buildings and technology they would slowly be able to wear down the production of the enemy until they could no longer generate enough of an income to fund the war.  It is a tricky [gambit] because by putting all of your resources toward war early if the enemy is able to somehow form a defense you will find yourself at a serious disadvantage [mid game].  If a player on the opposing team knows that a [zerg rush] is coming or strongly suspects it they will build a defensive structure in their base.  When I played Starcraft we usually had a no-zerg rule because it  made the games less fun.  Either the zerg [rusher] won in the first few minutes, or the person who [deflected] the zerg rush would win shortly after.  By imposing a ten minute non-expansion [peace treaty] some of the best epic battles were fought.
	
	In MMORPG's a popular way to beat a battle is by using overwhelming numbers, and the term [zerging] was borrowed from starcraft to define this.  This can often accomplish a feat with minimal skill and or gear, however many games now take this into effect and design encounters so that after a certain threshhold of players it becomes more difficult to manage the encounter.  For example, a few well placed hidden pits around a boss that when someone falls into them it releases a wave of ravenous creatures against the raid.  In  this case having a hundred people almost completely ensures that some idiot will fall into the traps no matter how many times you tell everyone where they are and how not to fall into them.
	
	In other MMORPG's which are player vs player zerging is often seen when one team or player is playing so far above the other teams that the losing side finally builds up a force large enough to win purely by flesh count.  [DAOC] was a game where this occured often by placing barriers to PVP that forces could camp.  If the force camping the [bottleneck] into the frontiers was good then it would do one of two things.  1.  It could [demoralize] the enemy and shut down [RVR].  2. It would create a buildup of players behind the bottleneck that would eventuall form a zerg.
	
	Zergs were considered by some a [necessary evil] in DAOC, but many considered them a [design flaw] in the game.
		Example: Starcraft [zerging].
		Human Vs. [Zerg].

zergling rush
	(2005-01-13 +101/-7)
	A tactic used in [Blizzard's] 1998 release of "StarCraft."  The Zerg were one of 3 playable races, bug-like creatures that created units through evolution, morhping, and hatching.  The [Zergling] was the basic infantry unit, capable of only melee attacks.  However, in a multiplayer situation, a single larva (the basic unit from which all Zerg units morph) will morph into two [Zerglings], creating a cheaply made swarm at a rapid pace.  Used for quick ends to multiplayer games and is often referred to in both negative and postive lights.
		Example: He wiped out my [SCV's] and my [command center] in 90 seconds flat with a [Zergling Rush].

	(2005-06-07 +30/-16)
	n,v. To [overwhelm] an opponent through the use of [cheaply] made units at the expense of any long-term strategy (taken from [Blizzard's] "StarCraft").

	A series of video game reviews presented by TheEscapist.com, written and hosted by Ben [Yahtzee Croshaw]. New episodes are published every week, on a Wednesday.
	Despite several attacks on Croshaw, many simple minded people have failed to grasp that Zero Punctuation is not about reviewing, but CRITICISING a game. Croshaw has stated on various occasions that he is primarily a [critic], not a reviewer, and anyone who cannot understand that should not bother watching his videos if they are merely going to [nerdrage].
		Example: "But, like a glass of milk with a spider in it, towards the end it all goes horribly wrong." Croshaw during his [Dark Void] review.
		
		"Recently we recieved a mail from soneone whose name i forget explaining that they were going to stop watching Zero Punctuation." Croshaw starting the Wii Sports Resort review.
		
		"but you dont call a sewage technician to [redecorate] your bathroom, and you you didnt come to me to hear how a game is good. Not when every other review has done it already." Croshaw providing the point that he is a critic, during the Batman [Arkham Asylum] review.

	(2008-12-09 +516/-499)
	A video review series by Ben "[Yahtzee]" Croshaw. Gained popularity on Youtube with a speed not seen since the Angry Video Game Nerd, and after only two quite funny videos was hired by online magazine [The Escapist]. After being hired by The Escapist, the jokes in the reviews started to get less subtle, and subsequently less funny. Eventually, the guy simply got obnoxious, often making off-topic rants against anyone and anything that earned his ire, most egregious when he said that Halo was unoriginal, then later said that he had never played a Halo game in his Halo 3 review. The rampancy of his unchecked ego became most obvious in his "review" of [Super Smash Bros Brawl], where he simply spent half of the video bashing anyone who may like Smash Bros, then dedicated a whole video to the [hate mail] his excuse for a review generated. He seemed quite surprised that people responded negatively to the fact that he had spent two minutes simply bashing anyone who doesn't share his tastes. Has a legion of idiotic fanboys who will declare that Yahtzee proves that whatever game he reviews has just been PUHOWNED!!1 and that Yahtzee is the only reliable reviewer, then yelling at anyone who disagrees with Yahtzee that his videos are for humour value only and shouldn't be taken seriously, too busy trying to earn [Yahtzee's] love to notice the contradiction.
		Example: [Yahtzee]: Hello, time for a new Zero Punctuation video. Today, I will bash X game for reasons that are stereotyped and [just not funny]. I will then talk about how fans of X game or console are idiots and how they are ruining the whole gaming experience for me, because the personal opinion of a single person holds sway over the entire gaming industry and I am immature/stupid enough to care what other people are playing. Also, people who pay attention to reviews are dumbasses and should pay fifty to sixty dollars for a game that they might not even like, because every gamer works for a company that will reimburse them so long as they make a review about it.
		Fanboys: [YAHTZEE] JUST [PWNZORED] THOSE BITCHES! I'M GOING TO GO TO [TV TROPES] AND PUT A VAGUELY RELATED QUOTE ON EVERY GAME TROPE ARTICLE THAT WOULDN'T EVEN BE DISTINGUISHABLE FROM THE THREE MILLION OTHER SNARKY REVIEWERS IF NOT FOR "Yahtzee, Zero Punctuation"  AT THE BOTTOM! *faps to Portal*

	(2008-05-31 +275/-409)

zero tolerance
	(2004-06-24 +86/-11)
	A policy that was put into use by United States schools and other establishments soon after the [Columbine] tragedy.
	In practice, zero tolerance policies allow for no weapons or dangerous objects in school.
	However, the noun "weapon" can mean "an object that can be used to [cause harm]"; the phrase "dangerous objects" is a plural of the same meaning; therefore, almost any object can be considered a weapon.
	Because of this, overzealous officials often unleash horrificaly exaggerated sentences for the [silliest] of things.
		Example: A 7-year-old boy was [suspended] for [pretending] to shoot his [classmates].

	(2004-06-23 +91/-12)
	A "get tough" policy of making no exceptions in regards to a particular (usually criminal or undesirable) matter, born as a response to a general sense of uneaven application of rules and punishments.
	
	To [react] to a proscribed activity or substance with absolute [prejudice]... Without regard to [mitigating] circumstances or conditions.
		Example: I don't care if you've got [glaucoma], we have a [zero tolerance policy] to drugs, including marijuana.
		
		We will react to [sexism] and racism with zero tolerance.

	(2004-06-24 +56/-10)
	[Authoritarian] rule system whereby breaking of [the rules] is taken very seriously and [punishment] is overly severe to get the message through.
		Example: The dictator took a [stance] of zero tolerance on ideaology that caused him any [disrepute], and so gave his political opponents acid [baths].

	(2004-09-23 +26/-5)
	A common phrase referring all lack of being able to [tolerate] something.  Often a policy referring to various rules to increase strictness and [banish] all regard for anything against the [zero tolerance policy].
		Example: "Schools have a [zero tolerance policy] to guns, understandably, but even leather trenchcoats, pieces of a weapon, chains, certain 'threatening' [perephinelia], and all [sorts] of other things.  Pretty soon, there will be a zero tolerance policy for CLOTHES."
		-me

	(2005-12-29 +23/-5)
	A policy, usually by [American schools] that any reference to a gun, violence, or drugs will get you [expelled] automatically with no [trial].
		Example: Because of zero tolerance, [Markie] was [suspended] for pointing a chicken [strip] at a teacher and said, "bang!"

	(2006-03-05 +35/-9)
	Besides being used to describe [draconian] and uniform (goodbye punishment that fits the crime) policys of law enforcement and schools, zero tolerance can also refer to the [war on drugs] in another way.
	
	It refers to that no drugs (though not as much towards alcohol since the alcohol companies help fund [anti-drug] organizations bullshit) are acceptable to be taken recreationaly. Pure abstinence over drugs. Too bad for them humans don't work that way. There have been drug users for as long as humans have known of their existence. 
		Example: It doesn't know how many this is your [brain on drugs] commercials you air, how many people you arrest and how many civil rights you violate, people will always use and abuse drugs. Whatever the hell drug abuse means.... 
		
		And people looking to sell them will always exist no matter how draconian the laws are.
		
		[Zero tolerance] once again = [zero intelligence]

	(2005-10-17 +42/-18)
	Politician speak for [Zero Intelligence].
	
	[Zero Tolerance] laws exist to punish the innocent. The guilty already are already fucked so having strict, uniform punishments regardless of the circimstances of the "crime," the persons criminal record and the persons intentions is just stupid.
	Anybody who supports [zero tolerance] policys need to be thrown into a [concentration camp] until they arent dumbasses. For I have zero tolerance for stupidity.
		Example: Being arrested for being [DWI] even though you are far from being drunk. [Mandatory] [minimum] sentences.
		
		As far as school zero tolerance policys go, read around www.zerointelligence.net.

	(2004-06-25 +16/-7)
	Meant to be taken as a strong [deterrent] against breaking a rule, as the consequences will be severe, however, often zero tolerance is an [idle threat] and one or even two tolerances are actually [implemented].
		Example: The school claimed that there would be a zero tolerance alcohol [policy], but [the football] players only had to serve one [detention].

	(2003-09-26 +16/-8)
	[The automatic] [death sentence] to your [education].
		Example: 1 marijuana [joint] = 10 days [suspension]/[180 days] expusion

Zero Two (Kirby 64)
	(2009-02-18 +89/-16)
	One of the more disturbing Nintendo Villains. It is the reincarnation of Zero from Kirby [Dreamland] 3. Zero died at the end of the game, but came back with an angelic form, possibly proving its death. (Yes [Zero Two] and Zero are the same being, some become confused)
	
	Just like old Zero, Zero Two is shown bleeding in Kirby, mostly from its eye or around that area. It is a large ball shaped white creature, with no facial features other than a giant red eyeball in the middle of its face. It has polygonal wings with [red tipped] feathers at the end, soaked in blood. A giant band-aid covers the top of its head and it also has a halo. Its ball shaped body ends in a small peak at the bottom of its body, which is its tail. It growls into a long green [thorny] rose stem-like tail when the halo and eye is hit enough times by [Kirby's] Crystal Gun. That is the [weak point], the only point where damage is taken.
	
	Zero Two appears in [the Kirby] 64 game for the Nintendo 64. He is the true final boss, not Miracle Matter.
	
	If ALL crystal shards are found, and Miracle Matter is defeated again, the path to [Dark Star] opens. Dark Star is where the true final boss of the game, Zero Two appears.
	
	Zero Two can also be written as 02. It is pronounced Zero Two as its official name, not Zero squared, oxygen, "O" two. The tags labeled oxygen, "O" two or Zero squared were included to show others this is the incorrect spelling/pronounciation of the name.
	
	Zero Two is the creator of all the dark matter. It is not known if it has a gender or not. Zero Two lives a miserable existance to never have the blessing to feel any positive emotions at all. In jealousy, Zero Two wreaks havoc on the worlds of Kirby. It felt if itself could not feel happiness, neither should everyone else.
	
	Zero Two is the first Nintendo villain I know of to show blood in an E rated game. Then again the blood wasn't too realistic, the bloods spray in circular clouds in the game.
	
	[SUPER SMASH BROS. BRAWL] CONTRIBUTION:
	[Zero Two's] theme in a more rock and roll remix version is [unlockable] in Brawl, the requirement being getting 5,000 coins total in Coin Matches.
	
	RUMOR OR NOT?
	Zero Three, the third form of Zero is said to appear in the Wii version of the Kirby game. True or not? Let's find out~
		Example: 1. [Zero Two] ([Kirby 64]) is one of the most badass Nintendo bosses ever!
		
		2. (reaches the true end of the game) Damn [what the frick], Kirby went all Neon Genesis Evangelion on us!

	It didn't catch much attention, due to being viewed by many to be just another unoriginal horizontal space shoot 'em up while lacking advertisements. It stayed obscure until late 2000 when the opening of the European version of its SEGA Mega Drive port was discovered as a mistranslation and was used by Kansas City computer programmer and part-time DJ, Jeffrey Ray Roberts, then aged 23, from [the Gabber] band "[The Laziest Men on Mars]" created a techno dance track titled "Invasion of the Gabber Robots", which remixed some of the Zero Wing video game music by Tatsuya [Uemura], [Toshiaki] Tomisawa, and Masahiro Yuge, with electronic versions of the quotes from its intro. Most notably "All your base are belong to us", said by an antagonist named CATS, which is similar to "owned", a slang word that originated among 1990s hackers, where it referred to "rooting" or gaining administrative control over another person's PC. This became an Internet meme for a long period of time and is still being used today, even against the arcade and PC Engine CD-ROM versions, although they lack the infamous opening and don't show CATS nor Engrish.
		Example: Most people thought [Toaplan] was responsible for the mistranslated opening of the European Mega Drive version of Zero Wing, but it was actually [SEGA] of [Europe's].

		Example: yes, yes im [talking] about you [you absolute] [zeta male]

	(2010-03-12 +988/-142)
	[Zeta male] refers to the 4th [social hierarchy] position among males. (alpha - top, beta - second, omega - the rest). Zeta males consciously reject a the traditional social position as it is based on how they are valued by women. [Zeta's] can be straight, bi or gay.
		Example: I asked Jim to buy be a drink and he said [I should] pay [for it] myself. I guess he's [a Zeta] Male

	(2019-07-04 +127/-31)
	[A Zeta] males is the human equivalent of an F1 car. A Zeta male ([ZM]) is a Male who has transcended the traditional blue pill-imposed socio-sexual hierarchy consisting of Alpha, Sigma, Beta, Gamma, Omega and Delta.
	
	While [Zeta] males may have previously fallen within one or more of the positions on the spectrum at various phases in their lives, they can activate any of their modes if absolutely necessary. Zeta males either consciously or subconsciously do not fall within social or sexual hierarchical primate-evolved position as it is based on traditional female-imposed valuation of a male's worth. Rather, Zeta males have accumulated the best qualities of each position on the hierarchy, and range from soaring above and outside the glass pyramid of the levels like [the Theta] bird, or can also operate with stealth and cunning from below [the pyramid] after detecting it's operations like a thermal radar system, fully perceptive yet immune to and [transcendent] from the spectrum of disturbance and subjugation within the pyramid.
	
	Both Zeta Males and [Theta] males can be fully transcendent beings. But [Zeta's] are more complex creatures and the most complex species or gender on the planet.
		Example: Before the rather [raucous] Alpha male got a chance to fully wind up, like the lightning, the [Zeta male] very efficiently acted to instantly [neutralize] the rather primal attempts.

	(2021-07-08 +141/-70)
	[Stupid bullshit] made by retards based off of refuted research on [captive] wolf moms and dads. This also goes for beta males, alpha males, and whatever bullshit [the losers] who pedal this crap come up with next.
		Example: person 1: Im [a zeta] male.
		person 2: I think [you mean] [fucking moron].

	(2018-05-11 +13/-5)
	[Masculinist] theory designing a stand-alone category in the structure of male dominance. In this theory, the males are divided in several categories including mainly Alphas (dominant), Betas (second) and Omegas (dominated) depending on their ability to pick a woman or their supposed status before a woman.
	The [Zetas] are thought as independent outsiders that do not let themselves be defined by women's relationship to them. They are characterised by that refusal along with the rejection of traditionalism and any relationship in which they may be dominated, but not in which they may dominate.
	
	Seemingly a "third way" for many men that suffers from the alpha/omega dynamic, this theory supposes that men should be free and bold in their way of living, independently to women who would be an evil agent of a power structure they seek to [get rid off]. However, this is very damaging to the average male since this attitude can only single him out, feed him with the fantasy of a world in which women are a completely outside force of their life or create a [toxic masculinity] which only results in toxic social relations.
		Example: Chad is such an alpha, but all he thinks about is women. I'm [a zeta] male, I can live without them and just pick one up occasionally.
		That guy is such a beta, it sucks to be alpha-orbiting. I'm a zeta male, I can live without being entitled to an alpha and get all the women.
		
		Brad decided to act more like a zeta male recently.
		- [How's it] holding up ?
		- I don't know, some girls thought he became some kind of an individualistic feminist when he explained it; but really it's the same as before but he does not look his crush in the eyes anymore.

	(2009-01-20 +179/-701)
	What idiots refer to as the opposite of an [Alpha male], as they don't realize the last letter of the Greek [Alphabet] is [Omega]. 
		Example: He was [a Zeta] [male], in more [ways] than one. 

	(2019-07-05 +15/-66)
	Male who is so [beta] he has moved down [the alphabet] to be [a zeta]
		Example: Your like [beto o'rourke] but even more beta so zeta [o'rourke].
		
		[Zeta male]: a male so beta that he has moved down the alphabet to be a [zeta male]

	(2011-05-12 +591/-89)
	A term coined from the star Zeta Persei of the constellation [Perseus], named for the Greek God Perseus, slayer of Medusa, the female monster that feminists eventually embraced as representative of [feminist rage]. [Zeta Male] represents a slayer of the feminist monster.
		Example: Why didn't that guy [show respect] to that woman when he saw she could be placed first? He's [a Zeta] Male and lives on his own terms. Besides, what [reciprocal] obligation does that woman have to men but "choices".

	(2016-04-14 +18/-178)
	Normally the most violent of the group, during a fight the [zeta male] is [the vanguard] and inspires violence in others, is sometimes the antagonist of the alpha male when a peaceful [resolution] is looked for
		Example: [Jason] is [a zeta] male, he is always looking for a fight and never needs much of an [excuse]

It is a modified version of [Invision] Power Board version 1.3. [Zetaboards] was made public in March 2006.
	
	Limitations of ZetaBoards include the lack of FTP access, editing restrictions and inability to access the [MySQL] database directly, as the software is remotely hosted. Also, e-mail notification of new topics, replies to existing topics and notification of new registrants is not part of the standard ZetaBoard package.
	
	Google [AdSense] is present on all forums to allow for the free cost to forum admins to host their forums on their own domain.
	
	Users now have the option to purchase ad removal for their forum. After board [conversions] from [InvisionFree] to ZetaBoards began, multiple bugs and glitches were found among the converted forums. While the Zathyus team informed its users that converting from ZetaBoards back to InvisionFree would not be possible, many forum owners expressed concern on the company website as to the fact that they are unable to return to InvisionFree due to disappointment with the new system or problems arising from faulty code or lack of support for some skins and themes.
		Example: Zetaboards deserves to have a [definition] [posted] here in [Urban Dictionary].

	(2009-08-04 +108/-25)
	[Cronus] [sired] several children by Rhea: [Hestia], [Demeter], [Hera], Hades, and Poseidon, but swallowed them all as soon as they were born, since he had learned from Gaia and Uranus that he was destined to be overcome by his own son as he had overthrown his own father— an oracle that Zeus was to hear and avert. But when Zeus was about to be born, Rhea sought Gaia to devise a plan to save him, so that Cronus would get his retribution for his acts against Uranus and his own children. Rhea gave birth to Zeus in Crete, handing Cronus a rock wrapped in [swaddling] clothes, which he promptly swallowed.
	Rhea hid Zeus in a cave on Mount Ida in Crete. According to varying versions of the story:
	He was then raised by Gaia.
	
	He was raised by a goat named [Amalthea], while a company of Kouretes— soldiers, or smaller gods— danced, shouted and clashed their spears against their shields so that Cronus would not hear the baby's cry. He was raised by a nymph named Adamanthea. Since Cronus ruled over the Earth, the heavens and the sea, she hid him by dangling him on a rope from a tree so he was suspended between earth, sea and sky and thus, invisible to his father.
	
	He was raised by a nymph named Cynosura. In gratitude, Zeus placed her among the stars.
	
	He was raised by Melissa, who nursed him with goat's-milk and honey.
	
	He was raised by a shepherd family under the promise that their sheep would be saved from wolves.
	
	Laurel-wreathed head of Zeus on a gold [stater], Lampsacus, c 360-340 BC (Cabinet des Médailles)
	Zeus becomes king of the gods
	After reaching manhood, Zeus forced Cronus to [disgorge] first the stone (which was set down at Pytho under the [glens] of [Parnassus] to be a sign to mortal men, the [Omphalos]) then his siblings in [reverse order] of swallowing. In some versions, [Metis] gave Cronus an [emetic] to force him to disgorge the babies, or Zeus cut Cronus' stomach open. Then Zeus released the brothers of Cronus, the Gigantes, the [Hecatonchires] and the [Cyclopes], from their dungeon in Tartarus, killing their guard, Campe. As a token of their appreciation, the Cyclopes gave him thunder and the thunderbolt, or lightning, which had previously been hidden by Gaia. Together, Zeus and his brothers and sisters, along with the Gigantes, Hecatonchires and Cyclopes overthrew Cronus and the other Titans, in the combat called the Titanomachy. The defeated Titans were then cast into a shadowy underworld region known as Tartarus. Atlas, one of the titans that fought against Zeus, was punished by having to hold up the sky.
	After the battle with the Titans, Zeus shared the world with his elder brothers, Poseidon and Hades, by [drawing lots]: Zeus got the sky and air, Poseidon the waters, and Hades the world of the dead (the underworld). The ancient Earth, Gaia, could not be claimed; she was left to all three, each according to their capabilities, which explains why Poseidon was the "earth-shaker" (the god of earthquakes) and Hades claimed the humans that died.
	Gaia resented the way Zeus had treated the Titans, because they were her children. Soon after taking the throne as king of the gods, Zeus had to fight some of [Gaia's] other children, the monsters [Typhon] and [Echidna]. He vanquished Typhon and trapped him under a mountain, but left Echidna and her children alive.
	Zeus was brother and consort of Hera. By Hera, Zeus sired Ares, Hebe and [Hephaestus], though some accounts say that Hera produced these offspring alone. Some also include [Eileithyia] and Eris as their daughters. The conquests of Zeus among nymphs and the mythic mortal progenitors of Hellenic dynasties are famous. Olympian mythography even credits him with unions with [Leto], Demeter, [Dione] and Maia. Among mortals were [Semele], Io, Europa and [Leda].
	Many myths render Hera as jealous of his amorous conquests and a consistent enemy of Zeus' mistresses and their children by him. For a time, a nymph named Echo had the job of distracting Hera from his affairs by incessantly talking: when Hera discovered the deception, she cursed Echo to repeat the words of others.
	Hera is also represented as having despised [Ganymede], a Trojan boy whom he brought into Olympus to be cup-bearer to the gods as well as his lover.
		Example: I think "Zeus" is "Zεúç"! Zeus is a [Greek god], and a great god! *[cheers]* [Hurray] for Zeus!!!

		Ancient Greek Guy 2: Whom? [Hades].

	(2006-02-03 +234/-58)
	Number 6 of Organization XIII
	Also known as the "[Shadow Walking] [Tactician]"
	
	Like Axel, Zexion, the "Shadow Walking Tactician", is a skilled manipulator by nature, though as we discover, not skilled enough. Appearing in Chain of Memories, his talents lay outside of battle, even to the point where he does not possess a weapon; he is the only Organization member who does not fight in a gameplay battle and lacks a voice actor.
	
	He is one of two Organization members who appear only in [Riku's] story. He has the ability to identify individuals by their scent, sensing when they die, and seems to be able to do so from great distances. His element is shadow.
	
	Zexion informs [Vexen] and [Lexaeus] when he senses two new scents in the lowest basement of [Castle Oblivion]. One of the scents is Maleficent, and he senses that she is eliminated by the other visitor, one with a scent "[exactly similar]" to that of the Superior. With little information on what was happening, he and the others decide to await development. Not long after, he identifies the other guest in the castle: [Riku]. He observes the boy's progress through Castle Oblivion until [Vexen's] death, when he and Lexaeus decide that they should use Riku just as they believe [Marluxia] will use Sora.
	
	After [Larxene], Lexaeus and even Marluxia are killed, Zexion sees that Riku is no longer needed and attempts to destroy him himself. He leads Riku into a manifestation of Destiny Islands, Sora and Riku's home, in which Riku sees his friends disappear. Zexion appeares and wages psychological war on Riku, telling him about how he threw away his friends and his home, opened the door to darkness, and destroyed his islands. Following Riku's battle with a Darkside Heartless, Zexion uses his power to disguise himself as Sora and attacks him, telling him that he's become nothing more than a pawn of the darkness. He engulfs Riku in light, but a vision of Kairi manages to convince Riku to shed his fear of the darkness. With newfound strength, Riku follows [Zexion's] scent through the light and strikes him, but Zexion escapes. His escape was short-lived; Axel brings the Riku Replica down to him and convinces the replica that he can become real by gaining power that the real Riku does not have. The replica agrees, and with [Axel's] suggestion, strikes down Zexion without difficulty.

	A Zexion is World Of Warcraft slang for somebody who overly brags about their items / achievments manily in guild chat and will at any oppurtunity try to [upstage] anybody who releases information about his or her Items / Achievments.
	
	To do a 'Zex' is to link in items continuously to the [annoyment] of fellow guild members and thriving on having better or higher level items or completing better or higher level tasks. Typically a 'Zex' would also report players [to World] of Warcraft administrators for extremly minor offences.
	
	The word originates from the Super Friends guild on the european server Dunemaul where a player was accepted into [the guild] only to repeatedly annoy fellow members.
		Example: SuperFrieds Member : check out this cool new Sword of [Omen]
		
		Zexion : Yer thats ok but i just got Better Sword of Omen , Drangon [Spunk Mail] , Leet Boots etc...

	Previously called [Rhodesia], Zimbabwe geographicaly lies in Southern Africa, North of South Africa and between [Botswana] and Mocambique.  The name originated from the famous "Zimbabwe Ruins" in the country and was addopted in 1980 when the country became independent.
	
	The ruling party of Zimbabwe, [ZANU]([PF]), (which stands for "Zimbabwe African National Union Patriotic Front") has been in power since 1980 and was originaly heralded as a [liberating] and heroic force.  Under the rule of Robert Mugabe, president since independince, the country has slowly been deteriating.  At independince, Zimbabwe had a [flourishing] economy based on agriculture as well as an opertunity to construct a new and free political arena, particularly after the era of white rule.  This opertunity was passed by as the rulling party started to remove any democratic oposition or barrier to their mantainince power.
	
	Recently the situation has [escalated] to a human rights tragady.  Under the governments "Land Redistribution Scheme," land that had been leagly owned by white farmers has systematicly been ocupied and eventualy taken over.

	That def was subbed lately, spelled as [zayna] and I felt  them nostalgic love [pangs] again as that was the name of one fineass gurl I knew back at my University of Jordan days. 
	
	Her name was [Zina] and she studied Eng. Lit. (majored first as an Italian/Mod. [Langs] student, but changed mind and 'heart' cause Eng. Lit. was my major). She'd stare at me all of the time like I was some kinda god or something! I mean, she was all over me. I never took pity on her, since I was an older guy (32 ffhs!), puffing my [ciggie] smoke as if I didn't give it!
	But, Zina kept staring at me and coming to the lects I was attending setting her diggityass fine bod in front of me, wearing her low-cut tops that she'd keep pulling down fer me to dig/see her coffee-colored [bare skin].
	
	The guys at the U were nothing but a pile of goon: telling me how I should 'go take her for a ride!' and how 'easy she's man'! On my dead father's grave, [Zina's] feet-dirt that's sits between her thimble-tiny toes is worth the lot of them assfucks! Huh!
	
	Then came the moment of truth when we both attended the same [lect]. and the same freeze-ass attitude on my side continued. Comes the time of firsts, she 'talked' to me asking about "how hard was the 'zam?", Zina mumbled. She also told me something about how she had bet with a girlfriend of hers that she'll 'zabhit' me. Now, 'zabhit' in Aarbic is the guy's-only art of 'getting the girls' one admires or likes to hang with, or fuck or maybe befriend...and that jus' hit me [stonko]! How ballsy she's?! "Fine!", I said..."if ya want me to be one friend o'yers then here...the door is open".

	I am a cold-hearted dickhead with a badge to prove it! This def. is the badge I needed. I don't care or give a monkey's nutscak if it gets refused: I already lost that girl! I lost that 'good' half-Greek [wifeable] girl fer ever!

zionazism

	(n) practical mix of the words 'Zionist' and 'Nazi' to compare the fascist mentality. The current zionazi ideology has developed as a result of the Nazi atrocities committed during the early part of the 20th century, and seems to have adopted many of its fascist ideas of [ethnic cleansing], especially in Israel. In this holocaust memorial state and its surrounding areas (occupied Palestinian territories) you will find confirmation of racism being practiced against the Arabic speaking populations - even those who were born citizens of the state of Israel are regarded as second-class citizens. Segregation is the plan as is shown by the separation/isolation barrier (more of a segregation wall) designed to 'keep out [suicide bombers]/terrorists' or more likely to keep Muslims and Jews separated through [apartheid] of the former Palestinians by stealing their land.
		Example: The current [Zionazism] practices are eliminating [Palestinian] people, through the act of [ethnic cleansing].

	A Zionist is a person who believes that Jews have the right to a national home in their ancestral homeland- the land of [Israel]. Zionism is a modern national [liberation] movement with ancient roots. Its purpose is to grant self-determination- a right of all people- to the Jewish people through the re-establishment of a Jewish [homeland] in the land of Israel
		Example: You don't need to be [Jewish] to be a Zionist. Only human!
		You don't need to be Jewish to be a Zionist. There are [Muslim] Zionists and [Christian] Zionists too!

	(2022-03-24 +1339/-2357)
	To be a Zionist, you must acknowledge the historical, archeological, and genetic undeniable fact - that Jewish people are an indigenous people who originate from [Judea] (Now called Israel) and not just a religion that you can leave. Therefore believing - that Jews, who were kicked out of Israel over the ages, can come back to their ancestral homeland.
	Zionism has nothing to do with the Government of Israel or the [plight] of Palestinians under the current government of Israel. In fact, many Zionists in Israel and abroad disagree with [the treatment] of Palestinians.
		Example: [I believe] that [Jews] have the right to self-determination in their ancestral [homeland] - therefore I'm a Zionist.

	· The only land that the Jews and the world have ever viewed as the legitimate home of the Jewish
	people is the land called Israel, or, by others, "[Palestine]."
		Example: A zionist believes that the Jewish people, or those of them who wish to, should [undergo] a national [rebirth] and
		[regeneration]. The Jews have a right to become a nation like any other nation - a free people in
		our own land.

Zionsville, Indiana
	(2010-01-06 +96/-37)
	Zionsville's a small but wealthy town of 12,000-ish people in Indiana, a few minutes northeast of [Indianapolis]. We're one of the nicest towns in Indiana (though that's not really saying all that much), as well as one of the richest, with an average income of $[84],000, and house price of $[430],000, both way over national average. Hell, we even have a fucking [Bentley] [dealership] here.
	Despite how rich people are in Zionsville, we aren't snobby or anything (cough, [Carmel]). It's actually really cool how people are here. When you meet someone from Zionsville, it's hard to tell how wealthy they are until you go over to their house or see their cars because they're so humble and nice. Like, both my parents are teachers, but I'm friends with doctors' kids, lawyers' kids, and CEOs' kids. Anyone can be anyone's friend here.
	Most people in Zionsville are the old-money families, who've been living here for generations. They've gone to college, worked their asses off for what they've got, and pass along those virtues to their kids.
	Now, yes, I know, I've been talking a lot about money. Off that subject; the people in Zionsville. The High School, besides being one of the top academic schools in the nation, is also the [whitest]. Out of [1800] kids, I bet like 10 are black, 50 are Asian, and we don't really have anything else here. Seriously, 98% of our town is white (NOT AN EXAGGERATION, [WIKIPEDIA IT]).
	In short, Zionsville's a really nice place, and given the choice, I'd still live here.
		Example: Chris: Dude, I'm moving.
		Will: What the fuck? Where?
		Chris: Some suburb called Zionsville, Indiana.
		Will: [Oh, dude], I've heard of that place, it's like the whitest fucking place in the world. Like, even [Russia's] more diverse than Zionsville.
		Chris: Yeah, dude, but it's all good, I've heard everyone's cool there, so it's [not so bad].

	(2010-12-05 +111/-77)
	Without a doubt, Zionsville is the most uninteresting place on the face of this earth. Whoever started Zionsville up should be [slapped in] the face twice and thrown down a flight of stares. Really, the most interesting thing that's even REMOTELY close to it is the [Indy 500], and nobody even gives a shit about racing. Otherwise, it's corn, corn, [old white people], suburbs, and corn.
	
	But don't get me wrong now. I spent several years in Indiana and I made friends that are like brothers to me. I think the people are really nice there, and everything is fairly modern.
	
	Sorry, but you can't deny it. If you can name me ONE interesting thing Zionsville has to offer it's citizens, I will personally walk up to your door and hand you a 1000 dollar check.
		Example: [Guy#1]: Hey man, a passed by Zionsville on the way to Chicago. Ever heard of it?
		
		Guy#2: Heard of what?
		
		Well there you have it. Zionsville, Indiana. I can guarantee you [99.9]% of the world's population have [never heard of it].

[Zodiac signs] aren't meant to be taken seriously, but surprisingly reflect on your actions and behavior, to a certain degree. [Everyone is different] even if you have the same Zodiac sign. These signs influence, they do not label. For example a Pisces will be influenced by its sign to be very emotional and dreamy, however this person has the ability to choose whether or not they want to go about with these instincts. A Gemini on the other hand, for example, will never share these traits, but might not fit their own sign very well either. It all depends on the individual. This is often why people dismiss [zodiac signs] as superstitions. Some will match their signs perfectly, some wont. These descriptions are sometimes general and vague but for the most part, correct.
		Example: It is said that [Zodiac signs] determine how old your soul is, with [aries] being the youngest and [pisces] being the oldest. Regardless if this is the case or not, it might make it easier for someone to understand them if you think this way. Say [a Cancer] is the teenager of the Zodiac signs, not all teenagers are exactly the same, but they all usually have the same intentions. For example, dating, sports, getting in trouble, video games, hanging with friends, some will rebel, some wont, ect. Each teenager is different, but their all pretty much on the same boat. This is a great way to think of Zodiac signs, not every Cancer will be the same but just like teenagers, they have similar ways of experiencing life.

	Zoies probably talks to herself at night about her problems since no one would listen. Her heart hurts so much because of everything she’s been through. She gives really good advice to people- but she can’t follow through with that advice herself. Her thoughts are probably “[I hate myself]” “why can’t i go back in time” “why do I have to be the eldest” and all that stuff; Zoies are caring, loving, beautiful inside and out, selfless and would do anything for anyone. Zoies can take a lot of annoyance, but when she’s really stressed she would start breaking and crying. Zoies can really fight for what’s right and would help a lot of people if what they’re doing is right. Zoies usually likes roses or [sunflowers]. Zoies birthday is usually in winter and Zoie loves snow. Zoies favorite weather is snow or when it’s cold but sunny. Zoie loves watching the [sunsets] and watching stars.

	Zoie usually is really pretty and short, she isn’t very social but she likes all her friends at present time. Sometimes she feels depressed or [unhappy] sometimes because she sacrifices everything for some of her loved ones or friends. She feels [unappreciated] and worthless at times, she can also feel very ugly and she wouldn’t love herself. Zoies are very insecure. If you know a Zoie, please tell her that she is beautiful just the way she is, and thank her for all the sacrifices she’s done. Zoies would probably change a lot for people to “fit in.” She would feel like an [outsider] in large groups. She isn’t really comfortable in a lot of calls and sometimes she doesn’t [fee] comfortable texting first. People would say, “Zoie has the [perfect life],” “Zoie is better than me,” and “Zoie gets all the attention, literally 3 boys like her!” But deep down Zoie can feel very lonely and worthless. And again, please thank Zoie for the sacrifices she’s done!
		Example: Chloe- Zoie is [so pretty], all the boys get her. She’s always so nice to me and stands up to people who treat people wrong!

	[Zombat] is a combination of the words combat and zombie, and refers to battling zombies in combat. The best way to defeat zombies, (according to various zombie movies) is through is destroying the brain, and the best way to do that is through headshots. 
	
	Close quarters combat is not recommended due to zombies can only attack in close quarters combat by biting. Zombies are undead slow creatures who's bite is infectious to the living, creating more zombies. Lone zombies are not much of a threat, however they often come in crowds and then they are a big threat. Their population often expands rapidly due to their infectious bite.
	
	Various organizations are dedicated to the elimination of the zombie menace through [zombat]. These organizations include [Zombie Squad], [FVZA], OZORT, and Tactical Underground. There are books out there by Max Brooks that deal with zombat and [zombie survivalism]. These include The Zombie Survival Guide and World War Z.
		Example: Our team engaged in [zombat] yesterday. We took out [the zombie] [horde] that was near St. Louis. However, we lost Chris to the zombie horde. Bless his soul.

Zombie
	(2004-10-17 +2934/-466)
	The [Walking Dead]. Scientific name [Homo Coprophagus Somnambulus]. 
	
	A deceased human being who has partially returned to life due to undeterminable causes. The brain retains base facilities, namely gross motor function. In its near-mindless state, it grasps no remains of emotion, personality, or sensation of pain. In rare cases, some of the reanimated have [reflexively] preformed routine activities from their past lives.
	
	The rotting bodies of the [undead] operate on a fraction of the level at which our bodies normally function. Circulatory, respiratory, and [digestive] systems are unaffected by [reanimation]. [Labored] breathing, choking, and moaning are reflexive but no oxygen is carried through the blood. The nervous system functions primarily within the brain and brain stem. Sensory reception is minimal at best and seemingly [unecessary] in the pursuit of prey. The undead are incapable of fatigue and will persist at any cost. They will even crawl when their legs have been removed. Even if the head is removed from the body, it will continue to live. The only way to stop the reanimated is to destroy the brain. To prevent reanimation in the recently [departed], [decapitate] the corpse and burn the body. 
	
	The only observable action a zombie takes part in is killing living creatures, especially humans, and eating them. Many theories and speculations surround this disturbing behavior. One theory is based on the thought that reanimation is the result of a contagious infection or virus, and that the primal drive to feed will spread the disease to other host bodies. Research has shown that although the majority of zombie attacks result in fatal wounds, all corpses return to life soon after passing, regardless of cause of death. Another theory is that zombies eat the brains of the living to refuel the "un-life" giving chemical serotonin. Because digestive and circulatory systems are incapable of bringing these elements to the brain, this just cannot be true. The final speculation seems the most obvious, that the dead feed for sustenance to [satiate] their unnatural [metabolism]. But because the gut has no function in the undead, this is also false. One documented encounter claims that a zombie was unable to move due to the sheer mass of undigested flesh resting in its distended gut. The creature continued to eat even after it's gut had burst open. Studies regarding the nature of feeding have proven that zombies will try to eat when their stomachs and even jaws have been removed. One explanation offers that the [walking dead] are the incarnation of death itself, a mockery of life that uses the vessels of the living to carry out their dark intentions, they are the opposite of life and are driven to simply undo it.
		Example: "When there's [no more room in hell], the dead [shall] walk [the earth]."

	(2018-10-01 +55/-8)
	When you [collect] all of your [roaches] [to roll] a blunt or joint if you are low on weed.

	In the context of dating, to [zombie] someone is to come back from the dead (re-initiate communication after an extended [absence]) after [ghosting] someone.

	(2005-08-28 +560/-241)

They live without beliefs other than the following- Go to school, get a job, make money, buy lots of crap, die. Frequently encountered in [the American school system] and the suburbs.
		Example: Steve: Do you think we should be in Iraq? Do you feel the war is right or wrong?
		John: Hey the new Hummer is only going to be 36K! and it comes in yellow!
		Steve: Should we devote more federal funds to conduct [stem cell] research?

	(2010-11-04 +38/-17)
	A [model citizen], and someone who we all should strive to be. Zombies don't hide behind their insecurities or lie to other people. They just want your brains. They don't need to exaggerate to make anyone feel better, but instead, being the upfront creatures that they are, make a [bull run] for your delicious flesh. They don't waste away life by making false friends, finding a girl or guy zombie only to be led on, and drinking their entire life to ease the pain. Nay, they do what they want ([eating brains]) at any cost, being shot in the head, blown up into a million pieces, being clobbered with blunt objects. But at the end of the day, battered and beaten, the zombie finds a way to moan and get on with his life. Isn't that the true secret to personal fulfillment?
		Example: Zombie 1: "Braaaaaaiins!"
		Zombie 2: "[Brains]?"

	(2010-04-01 +20/-8)
	Zombie- a human which has long deceased and has been reanimated by an unknown cause. Zombies can only be killed by dismemberment of their heads. A corpse must be mostly intact to become a zombie. To prevent an unneeded outbreak, I suggest you [cremate] any dead bodies.
	
	Zombies cannot climb, if caught in an outbreak, climb on to a roof. Zombies also cannot swim, they do not need air to survive either.
	
	If you are trapped in an outbreak, tight clothes and short hair are recommended.
	
	Do not report zombies to the police, they could just be an escaped [mental patient] or a [sleepwalker].
		Example: Run! That zombie might [eat you]!
		
		or
		
		[Uncle Fred] died three weeks ago... what is he doing with [the neighbor's] cat?

	(2009-04-30 +24/-13)
	There is much debate on what defines a being to be a zombie. Actually zombies can be broken down into different categories. I'll BRIEFLY describe some of the well known types, not ALL of them. Feel free to add information or tell me how far off [I am you] ass!
	
	For example, [the zombies] you battle in the [Resident Evil series](1 through 5 with many other suck dick side games) are humans turned into biological montrosities by being injected or coming into contact with different strains of [virus's] or other zombies that contracted the virus. Later in Resident Evil 4 and 5 the zombies are different than the first 3 games. People turn into zombies in the 4th and 5th installments by being forced fed a type of living organism or again, being injected with the virus. Dead bodies and animals can be reanimated much like the original zombie movies. In some cases the zombies will weild machine guns, stun rods, rocket launchers and shotguns. All of the zombies in the game series DO NOT [thrist] for brains or blood. They do not need any [nourishment] from a living body. They tend to blow your ass up or maul you to death.  These zombies DO NOT turn you into a zombie. They are fast and agile and have the basic motor skills of humans. Some of these undead have special abilities and some can turn into huge monsterous creatures that have qualities of different animals or humans. Example, you fight a giant [vampire bat] with the legs and the tail of an insect or scorpion in [Resident Evil 5]. These zombies do share some qualities of the original but not all. Honestly, I would rather call these zombies "infected organisms" due to the fact [the virus's] or the "Las Plagus" alter and transform some of the hosts. [Decapitation], grenades, unconventional weapons, and [mutliple] shots from conventional weapons are the best ways to drop these type of zombies in of all the games. 
	
	Voodoo zombies are more than likely the real origin of zombie lore. Some say dead people were brought back from the grave to run [amuck] in society creating chaos and murder. Some were brought back for the [shamans] [biding]. Others believe they were brought back from the grave to complete [unfinished business], such as a person wrongfully murdered. When bitten by these zombies you do turn into a zombie. They did feed for nourishment or were used as a weapon and then decapitated after their "job" was fulfilled.  
	
	
	The Night of [the Living Dead] type zombies are by far the best well known type of zombies in America and quite possibly the world. These zombies were actually reanimated to the land of the living much like their voodoo cousins but they do differ from them also. These zombies were lethal in numbers even though they were slow enough for an average person to run away from in an open area. They trapped and killed their victims by sheer numbers.  For some odd reason the humans in these films tried to hold up in houses only to have their barricaded walls and doors knocked down by hundreds of the slow, [lumbering] zombies. They do feed on humans for nourishment. Decapitation seemed to be the only way to stop them. 
	
	Like I said in the beginning there is much debate on what makes a zombie a zombie. Do they have to move [fast or slow]? Do they kill humans out of rage much like the 28 Day Later film or kill for nourishment? Are they the undead or Lucifers overflow of bodies coming from hell?
	
	One thing is for certain. Zombies and their undead counterparts are a pop culture phenomenon, have been always will be. Clothing, bands, comic books, magazines, movies, cartoons, games any form of media has been infiltrated by the "zombie horde". Some people around the globe actually have started organizations to prepare for the undead awakening. There is also a very popular book simply named "The Zombie Handbook" that will inform a person on detailed information on zombies, where to hold up, what not to use against zombies, so on and so forth.  
	
	Aim for the head and yes, zombies can climb. Oh yea and some have supernatural strength! ;)
		Example: Damn Joe thanks for watching my back! Now zombies are eating my brains from my skull like ice cream!
		
		Zombies Ate My Neighbors!
		[28 Days Later]
		I Am Legend
		Return of [the Living Dead]
		The Night of [the Voodoo] Zombie Nigga

	The one thing that has happened before, only to be [covered up] by our government
	Grab a shotgun, [machete], backpack, and family
	It's gonna be a [bumpy ride]
		Example: The Center for Disease Control has issued an emergency evacuation for the town of -LINCOLN, NEBRASKA- Due to an unknown virus. Between the hours of 06:00 to 20:00 emergency vehicular transports shall be issued to evacuate the residents of -LINCOLN, NEBRASKA- We warn any readers: DO NOT COME IN CONTACT WITH THE INFECTED FOR ANY REASON. Each infected individual so far has apparently ceased living, only to return to life with a berserk-like attitude. No additional information has been given to us about this "Zombie Apocalypse." However, we do possess the knowledge that these creatures are extremely deadly. [DO NOT attempt] to run away. In the [meantime], residents of -LINCOLN, NEBRASKA- should [barricade] themselves in their homes and wait for official instructions. Once infected, any persons bitten or somehow induced to succumb to the virus are to be considered EXTREMELY DEADLY and should be killed or [quarantined] AT ONCE. We have received word that the best way to "kill" the undead is to destroy the head or remove it completely. However, NOBODY should attempt to rebel against [the creatures] unless in an EMERGENCY SITUATION. Once dead, the bodies are to be burned to ensure that the virus is stopped from spreading to other cities or even states. This is a warning from [the CDC].

	(2008-11-04 +230/-70)
	[The end of the world] by way of biochecmically regenerated humans [thats only] plan is to kill off all life on the planet. Zombies are the [Archenemy] of the FreeAgents.
		Example: [Zombie apocalypse] has started we must [get to] a [safe place].

	Zombie Apocalypse (Latin: [apocalyptus] inmortuis) denotes the (total or [partial]) [extinction] of mankind by zombies and is one of the most common subjects in movies and computer games .
	Often used as an excuse by people playing zombie FPS .

		My Zombie Apocalypse Plan: [FPSRussia]

	(2010-09-11 +62/-55)
	The [zombie apocalypse] has begun. Actually it began many years ago, it has just been progressing rather slowly as far as apocalypses go.
	
	The leaders and perpetrators of the inevitable zombie apocalypse are creatures referred to as "psychiatrists". These individuals have medical degrees and legally prescribe people drugs that turn them into zombies. They get away with this by claiming these drugs help conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, when in fact all they do is cause people to have no emotions and give people an intense urge to consume human brains orally.
	
	Whether or not the psychiatrists themselves are zombies is open for debate. They may just be paid by the [zombiefied] government to spread the good [zombie word].
		Example: The [inevitable] Zombie Apocalypse has begun.

	(2013-03-12 +17/-25)
	The lamest form of Apocalypse and the least likely that consists of people wanting to become easy [bad asses] by confronting waves of really slow and or stupid zombies that are revived humans that want brains/ flesh. I even heard the white house wasted our tax dollars by creating an entirely separate [bunker] for a zombie apocalypse I really don't get the appeal behind it.The walking dead is not a really a good series either. Nothing happens for 20 minutes in the show and the characters are kind of lame and under developed, the video game is [shit too] it's not even a video game it's a bunch of [quick time] events that don't really effect the out come, but I get it, it's zombies. a Virus can't possibly revive corpses or command it's host to go kill other potential hosts. A Alien apocalypse is more bad ass so is a viral virus or even a meteor.
		Example: Idiot: I would kill so many zombies man, I have a [bunker] with an [armory], I spent a quarter of my salary for 10 years to create it man.
		Jimmy: You dumb ass, what a waste of money a zombie [apocalypse] is the least likely to happen.

zombie punch

	The [Zombie Punch] is an obscure sexual act, virtually unknown to the common public. While it is practiced by some, such occurances are seemingly quite rare. The Zombie Punch is a violent and illegal act, and should not be attempted by anyone, as it can be considered assault.
	
	The Zombie [puch] consists of several steps, and must involve at least one male participant. First, punchee must initiate oral sex on the [puncher]. The length of this phase various, based on the [staying power] of the puncher, and the skill of the punchee. Next, when the puncher is approaching climax, he must remove himself from his partner's mouth, and deliver a swift blow to the nose, hard enough to cause bleeding and slight disorientation, but not so hard as to render the punchee unconscious. Third, the puncher must quickly achieve orgasm of his own [volition], and ejaculate on his partner's face, preferably in lagre quantity, [all over it's] surface.
	
	Finally, if performed correctly, the punchee's face should be well covered in a smear of blood in semen, and be staggering about, lightly disoriented. At this point, the puncher runs over to the nearest [light switch], and begins to flick it on and off. If you have indeed succeeded, the effect given should be that the punchee looks to be staggering about like a Zombie, and thier face should look like that of the undead. The flicking of the lights provides a jerking effect to the movement, and affects vision as well.

		Example: "[Sky], I totally [Zombie] Punched your mom last night!"
		
		"So that's why she was all bloody and passed out in [the hall]..."

	(2004-10-17 +2934/-466)
	The [Walking Dead]. Scientific name [Homo Coprophagus Somnambulus]. 
	
	A deceased human being who has partially returned to life due to undeterminable causes. The brain retains base facilities, namely gross motor function. In its near-mindless state, it grasps no remains of emotion, personality, or sensation of pain. In rare cases, some of the reanimated have [reflexively] preformed routine activities from their past lives.
	
	The rotting bodies of the [undead] operate on a fraction of the level at which our bodies normally function. Circulatory, respiratory, and [digestive] systems are unaffected by [reanimation]. [Labored] breathing, choking, and moaning are reflexive but no oxygen is carried through the blood. The nervous system functions primarily within the brain and brain stem. Sensory reception is minimal at best and seemingly [unecessary] in the pursuit of prey. The undead are incapable of fatigue and will persist at any cost. They will even crawl when their legs have been removed. Even if the head is removed from the body, it will continue to live. The only way to stop the reanimated is to destroy the brain. To prevent reanimation in the recently [departed], [decapitate] the corpse and burn the body. 
	
	The only observable action a zombie takes part in is killing living creatures, especially humans, and eating them. Many theories and speculations surround this disturbing behavior. One theory is based on the thought that reanimation is the result of a contagious infection or virus, and that the primal drive to feed will spread the disease to other host bodies. Research has shown that although the majority of zombie attacks result in fatal wounds, all corpses return to life soon after passing, regardless of cause of death. Another theory is that zombies eat the brains of the living to refuel the "un-life" giving chemical serotonin. Because digestive and circulatory systems are incapable of bringing these elements to the brain, this just cannot be true. The final speculation seems the most obvious, that the dead feed for sustenance to [satiate] their unnatural [metabolism]. But because the gut has no function in the undead, this is also false. One documented encounter claims that a zombie was unable to move due to the sheer mass of undigested flesh resting in its distended gut. The creature continued to eat even after it's gut had burst open. Studies regarding the nature of feeding have proven that zombies will try to eat when their stomachs and even jaws have been removed.

zombies
	(2009-03-02 +164/-58)
	Zombies are the new Nazis in gaming. World War II is out, Zombie Apocolapse is in. They  are the new thing that you can shoot and shoot and shoot without getting bored (that is, until something new comes along and replaces zombies).
	Many current games now are about zombies or feature them in some way.
	
	A zombie is either an actual [undead] (which is the case with [Nazi Zombies]), or a human who was infected with a virus of some sort and have undead/zombie like charactoristics (like [Left 4 Dead]).
		Example: Gears of War 2: [Horde Mode]
		[Call of Duty World at War]: Nazi Zombies
		Halo 3: Infection mode
		Left 4 Dead
		[Dead Rising]
		Resident Evil 5
		Counter Strike: Zombie Mods
		Dead Space

	(2006-08-24 +273/-111)
	In popular culture, zombies commonly refer to the undead.  Generally, any formerly human creature that is no longer acting with freewill.  Often erroniously attributed to the Carribean practice of Voodoo in Western society, the zombie has been portrayed for thousands of years in cultures in India, China, and among Native Americans.  These include (but are not limited to the following):
	1. The Voodoo Zombie, which is a living human who has lost it's free will.
	2. The [Viral Zombie], which is a reanimated (usually human) corpse that has been brought back to life.
	3. The Chinese Zombie, which is a supernatural/spiritual being with a yellow piece of paper on its forehead, capable of moving very quickly, and jumping very far or flying.
	
	A number of [zombie survivalist] organizations ([ozort] for example) exist worldwide that set up contingency in the event of an outbreak of Viral Zombies
		Example: [Mankind] can be [easily] [destroyed] by zombies.

	(2005-04-10 +23/-33)
	[undead] brainsuckers, normally raised by a freak [natural disaster] or by means of a [necromancer]. The only way to permanently incapacitate one is to remove it's head completely.

	(2004-10-17 +2934/-466)
	The [Walking Dead]. Scientific name [Homo Coprophagus Somnambulus]. 
	
	A deceased human being who has partially returned to life due to undeterminable causes. The brain retains base facilities, namely gross motor function. In its near-mindless state, it grasps no remains of emotion, personality, or sensation of pain. In rare cases, some of the reanimated have [reflexively] preformed routine activities from their past lives.
	
	The rotting bodies of the [undead] operate on a fraction of the level at which our bodies normally function. Circulatory, respiratory, and [digestive] systems are unaffected by [reanimation]. [Labored] breathing, choking, and moaning are reflexive but no oxygen is carried through the blood. The nervous system functions primarily within the brain and brain stem. Sensory reception is minimal at best and seemingly [unecessary] in the pursuit of prey. The undead are incapable of fatigue and will persist at any cost. They will even crawl when their legs have been removed. Even if the head is removed from the body, it will continue to live. The only way to stop the reanimated is to destroy the brain. To prevent reanimation in the recently [departed], [decapitate] the corpse and burn the body. 
	
	The only observable action a zombie takes part in is killing living creatures, especially humans, and eating them. Many theories and speculations surround this disturbing behavior. One theory is based on the thought that reanimation is the result of a contagious infection or virus, and that the primal drive to feed will spread the disease to other host bodies. Research has shown that although the majority of zombie attacks result in fatal wounds, all corpses return to life soon after passing, regardless of cause of death. Another theory is that zombies eat the brains of the living to refuel the "un-life" giving chemical serotonin. Because digestive and circulatory systems are incapable of bringing these elements to the brain, this just cannot be true. The final speculation seems the most obvious, that the dead feed for sustenance to [satiate] their unnatural [metabolism]. But because the gut has no function in the undead, this is also false. One documented encounter claims that a zombie was unable to move due to the sheer mass of undigested flesh resting in its distended gut. The creature continued to eat even after it's gut had burst open. Studies regarding the nature of feeding have proven that zombies will try to eat when their stomachs and even jaws have been removed. One explanation offers that the [walking dead] are the incarnation of death itself, a mockery of life that uses the vessels of the living to carry out their dark intentions, they are the opposite of life and are driven to simply undo it.
		Example: "When there's [no more room in hell], the dead [shall] walk [the earth]."

	[The Zone] is an ethereal state of mind that propels you from mortal man to super human, to godlike status. Performance, whether physical or technically challenging, is elevated effortlessly beyond your normal level. You [feel no pain] within your body and your reactions and balance become unhumanly fast. Things that were difficult previously become effortlessly easy. Failure does not even enter your mind and does not even seem possible. You soar with the angels and ride, tall and proud beside the god [Helios], upon a golden winged chariot. You have become a god among mortal men.
	Unfortunately [the Zone] is an ephemeral place and in the way that you unknowingly entered the Zone (you just arrive, you don’t know quite how), you are unceremoniously [booted out] of it. This usually involves collecting all the pain that you missed out on when in the Zone and dishing it out in one big serving. Once you have left the Zone it is commonplace to try and fight your back into it, but this never works and, in fact, generally speaking [the zone] gets further away the harder you try to get to it.
		Example: Act 1: “In the Zone”
		Dude 1: Yo dude, you were totally fucking sick out there. You are in the fucking zone, man. [Give me some skin].

		Dude 2: Good man, I soar with the angels and ride, tall and proud beside the god [Helios], upon a golden winged chariot. I speak not to mortal man.
		{Translation: Fuck off, loser}
		Dude 1: You are such a fucking dick, fuck off
		{Translation: You are such a fucking dick, fuck off}

	Aka Gen Z
	Zoomer : [American kids] born between 2005-2020 who are internet obsessed, entitled, disrespectful clueless dipshits.

They are a bunch of jerky little snowflakes whose opinions don’t matter to anyone else.
		Example: It’s funny that these [stupid] little Zoomer’s think anyone [cares] about their [opinions].

	A Zoomer is a young adult, generally old enough to clash with [the Logan] [Pauler]/TikTok generation but not old enough to be a [90's kid]. Traditionally, people in this age range are referred to as Gen Z, although some particularly young, edgy, and racist ones often call themselves Zoomers in an attempt to invoke the legacy of Boomers.
		Example: Grandpa: "Ugh, [millennials]. Maybe if they put down that phone they wouldn't have to work three jobs just to barely support themselves [in this economy] that I helped tank."
		[Grandchild]: "Grandfather, for the last time, I am a Zoomer. [Millennials] are almost 30 now."

	The most annoying generation after boomers. Most [Zoomers] are under the age of 16 but think they know everything because they made Tik Toks in their rich parents houses all day. While Zoomers are the most accepting generation, they are also the most sensitive. Today a [zoomer] on Twitter said that being picky about food is a disability. That's what you get with Zoomers.
	
	Most of them are beyond obsessed with K-Pop to the point where they will spam fan [cams] all over twitter no matter how unrelated the Tweet is. Known for their [markedly] low IQ and [attention spam], Zoomers will likely be studied as the first generation to have full access to the internet as a kid. Zoomers like to spam random characters and repeat the same meme over and over again. In reality, Zoomers are just the 16 year old white girls right now and everyone knows 16 year old white girls are the worst people on the planet. [So basic] you can bait them into posting specific memes like "you dropped this king" without their 40 IQ brains realizing. Zoomers are stupid but accepting. So they're bad but not as trash as boomers. And they're all kids so, in 10 years they might be much better.

	(2010-06-01 +438/-70)
	The dualistic religious system founded by the Persian prophet [Zarathustra] (Zoroaster in Greek) and set forth in the [Avesta] in the late 7th or early 6th centuries BCE, teaching the worship of [Ahura Mazda] in the context of a universal struggle between the forces of light and of darkness. It is one of the most ancient of living religions and once the faith of the Persian Empire. It is also rooted in ancient Aryan traditions. Today there are less than 200,000 Zoroastrians, mostly in Iran, India, and the West. At the age of 30, Zarathustra was returning with river water for [haoma] for spring festival when he had a vision and was taken before Ahura Mazda, The Wise Lord, the supreme creator & his 7 created helpers, the Holy Immortals ([Amesha] Spentas) by the Vohu [Manah]. Zoroastrianism teaches that Ahura Mazda is the supreme god and all others are subordinate to him. It also teaches that the evil spirit, [Angra] [Mainyu] (Ahriman in Pahlavi) and his demons (daevas) upholds the Lie (druj) instead of Truth (asha). As a result, this creates conflict between humans who follow the Lie (dregvant) and those who uphold the Truth (ashavan).
		Example: The religion also teaches that each person has free will to choose, with consequences of happiness and misery. Zoroastrians believe that when someone dies, the body must be kept in home for 3 days while the soul hangs about it. On the 4th day, the corpse-bearer raise a massive Tower of Silence (dakhma) with a circular stone platform on the top inclined to a central wall. The body is stripped and then placed on this, exposed to [vultures] and elements. When the flesh is gone, the bones are swept into the well to [disintegrate]. This is done to minimize effects of decay on the air, fire, earth, and water. Many Parsis still use Towers of Silence, but those in Iran have shifted to earth [burial] and those in the West use burial or [cremation]. After this life, each person is judged at the Chinvat Bridge, shaped as a sword. It turns on its edge for the evil and they fall into an abyss of torment and the righteous [pass over] it as a broad and flat path to rewards in heaven. The traditional temple of Zoroastrianism is the Fire Temple. It has a central chamber with a stone platform on which fire is always burning in a metal [urn] on a bed of sand or ash. The priest ([magi]) keep the fire, perform rituals, prayer, and wear masks so they do not [pollute] the fire. The fire at Udvada north of [Bombay] is held to have burned for over 1,000 years.

	[Zarathustra] (in Greek, Zoroaster) was a Persian prophet who at the age of 30 believed he had seen visions of God, whom he called [Ahura Mazda], the creator of all that is good and who alone is worthy of worship. This was a departure from previous Indo-Persian [polytheism], and Zarathustra has been termed the first non-biblical monotheist (though [monotheism] in Zoroastrianism never took on the absolute quality that it assumed in Judaism and Islam). Though there is disagreement among scholars as to exactly when and where Zarathustra lived, most agree that he lived in eastern Iran probably around the sixth century B.C.E. 
	
	[Zoroastrian] theology is strongly dualistic. In his visions, Zarathustra was taken up to heaven, where Ahura Mazda revealed that he had an opponent, Aura [Mainyu], the spirit and promoter of evil. Ahura Mazda charged Zarathustra with the task of inviting all human beings to choose between him (good) and Aura Mainyu (evil). Consequently, Zoroastrianism is a highly ethical religion. Zarathustra taught that humans are free to choose between right and wrong, truth and lie, and [light and dark], and that their acts, words, and thoughts would affect their lives after death. He was thus the first to promote a belief in two heavenly judgments: of the individual soul right after death and of all humankind after a general resurrection. His ideas of heaven, hell, and the resurrection of the body profoundly influenced Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. Later Zoroastrianism conceived of an opposition between body and soul, though there was no suggestion in its theology that the body was evil and the soul was good. A wandering preacher from Mesopotamia named Mani developed those theories into an extreme form of [dualism] called Manichaeism. 
	The Zoroastrian "[Avesta]" ("Book of the Law") is a fragmentary collection of sacred writings divided into: [liturgical] works with hymns ascribed to Zarathustra; invocations and rituals to be used at festivals; hymns of praise; and spells against demons and prescriptions for purification. Compiled over many centuries, the Avesta was not completed until [Persia's] Sassanid dynasty (226-641 C.E.). 
	
	Zoroastrianism all but disappeared in Persia after the Muslim invasion of [637] C.E. Only about 10,000 survive in remote villages in Iran, but over the centuries many sought religious freedom in India.

It has become noticeably more popular after fans have read the comics following the show. In "The Promise: Part 2", Zuko and Suki share a questionably romantic moment after [Zuko's] ex-girlfriend, Mai, broke up with him. Another time when fans noticed a Zuki moment was during "The Promise: [Part 3]", when Suki stated that Zuko looked "so lonely" while they were trying to stop him from causing another war. By now, the fans were starting to get suspicious of [Suki's] intentions. In "The Search: Part 1", the readers had started to predict that Zuki was going to canon soon, and that Suki may just be the [Firelord's] new [Firelady]. Some people, though, believe that there isn't a chance for the two, because of Suki's current boyfriend [Sokka].

He was then banished with his wise [uncle Iroh] and would not be allowed home until he caught the Avatar, and thus return his honour.  
	In season 2 Zuko and [Iroh] become fugitives. Whilst Iroh just wants to start a new peaceful life, Zuko still yoyos between good and bad. A new persona is borne of this inner conflict - the Blue Spirit.

	Season 3 sees Zuko still struggling between good and evil. Although he now has his throne back, he feels guilt and anger because it was through his fault that his uncle was thrown in prison.

He escapes and follows Team Avatar to the Western Air Temple, where he offers to help teach Aang.

	 *    *   ^    ^    *    *
	FUck ME LET'S PLAY [ZUmi ZUmi]

The students who started this trend apparantly were not aware that there was already a word much like the one they had made however the meaning is close. Can be used in the context of: "You are a <i>zut</i>", meaning something along the lines of, "You are nasty or disgusting" or just shouting "[Zut]" is [tantamount] to saying, "Gross!".

Zutara
	(2006-11-16 +1434/-370)
	The pairing of Zuko and Katara on Nickelodeon's hit kid's program Avatar:The Last Airbender. Merits the largest fanbase in all of A:TLA shipping communities. Shippers of this particular pairing formulate arguments/discussions through the subtle forshadowing, parallels, and hints that occur in the show. Is currently, for the most part, a fanon ship, but Season Two's finale is hinting towards honest development of these two character's relationship.
	
	(This entry will be edited as the series progresses) 
	
	Interferes with: Kataang, Maiko, Karu, Jettara, Zujin, Soko.
	Unaffected Ships: Tophaang, Teoph, Kohla, Maang, Taang, Ty Lokka/[Tykka], Tokka, [Yuokka], Sukka,Sokkai, [Sokkla] [Smellershot], Azulet, Zhaozula, Jiroh, Azulang, [LoRohLi], etc.

	(2008-01-04 +556/-191)
	The popular pairing, or "shipping", between 2 characters in an  anime-style Nickelodeon show called "Avatar: the Last Airbender." Consists of Katara, a female water bender from [the South Pole] and Zuko, a male [fire bender] from the Fire Nation. This "shipping" is often hinted among the series, but also considered very unlikely because they are opposites (fire and water, blue and red... etc.). However, this concept is also used to explain the shipping, because 'opposites attract'. The common theory of [Ying-Yang] also applies to this universal pairing.
		Example: Zutara is so [canon] [now]!

	(2010-04-27 +266/-442)
	A [fanon] ship from Avatar: The Last Airbender that ships together [Zuko] and [Katara], who never showed any romantic interest in each other. Despite the fact that it's been proven as crack and never became canon, many continue to rabidly ship it, under the delusion that it "should have happened", and hating the show's creators for not granting their wishes.
		Example: "[Kataang] is pedo because of their two year [age difference], but the three year age difference in Zutara means nothing!"
		
		"Whatever, you know Zutara should have happened. Why? [Because I said so]."

	(2010-08-06 +133/-434)
	Any [concept] or idea that is ridiculous and makes [no sense]. "Zutara" can be used as an adjective or an [interjection].

Zynga
	(2009-08-19 +447/-34)
	Something so totally beyond repair after being altered, adjusted, [fiddled] with, meddled with and generally [mucked] about with is totally "[Zynga'd]".
	
	Any attempt to make it better (and there has to be many in order to deserve this definition) only makes things worse and therefore enhances the definition of being "Zynga'd".
		Example: There was once a game on FaceBook which was exceptional. The game was great, the Group Forum associated with the game was friendly and amusing and everyone helped each other along with tips and game play strategies (well they had to, the company in charge of the game had nothing to do with it). The happy people of this Group Forum thought up new ways to enhance their game playing and all was going well until the weekend of the "[Valentine's Day Massacre]" event. The day before the event was to begin, the game itself was altered beyond recognition.
		
		All attempts to make the game playable to the standard of the previous game were unsuccessful and led to further "Zynga-ups" in the game. Further attempts to improve the game to make it unexploitable have proven to be [unmitigated] failures and the developers of the game prove themselves to be inept, incompetent and inadequate to the tasks put to them.
		
		[Tha game] is an application made by a company called Zynga - hence the definition.

	Despite their games only being about as much fun as your screensaver at work and taking less effort to make than the average "10,000 Games on 1 CD!" [shovelware], they tapped into the Pavlovian center of grandmothers the world over to the tune of billions of dollars in revenue and a nearly 20 billion dollar initial stock offering in 2011.

		Example: Zyzz [is God] - [no homo]

	(2011-01-25 +2345/-2329)
	A "Zyzz" is a lifestyle stereotype, and slang shorthand derived from the common first name "[Aziz]" (pronounced "[Ziz]"), used within some ethnic [bodybuilding] circles in the West.
	
	Closely associated with an ostentatious, steroid-fueled bodybuilding lifestyle, a typical Zyzz is a young man from an Middle Eastern background who is fixated upon their own physical appearance, with a particular focus on muscle development.
	
	A Zyzz is stylistically related to the 'guido' or 'wog', but unlike [the guido] who hails from Italian roots, a Zyzz will be of an Arab, or Iranian ethnic background. A Zyzz is also specifically focused on the gym lifestyle, differing from [the guido's] slightly wider spectrum of sleazy activities.
	
	Like their cultural cousin the guido, a Zyzz may loudly play dance music, bleach their teeth, live in the gym, frequent tanning salons, get highly visible tattoos, cosmetic surgery, and will wear clothes & other items aimed at attracting attention to themselves.
	
	A Zyzz type ethnic douchebag is often pathologically [self-aggrandizing], and will alienate others with their attention seeking & wild claims. To others, the majority of their 'boasts' come across as [vainglorious], and grounded in narcissistic fantasy.
	
	A typical Zyzz wants others to believe they are fantastic ("fully sick brah!"), at least according to the shallow value-system of some greasy world-view. To this end, a Zyzz will seek out followers, gaining low-IQ sycophants in the process.
		Example: Typical Zyzz: "[Come at me] [brah]! I'll fuckin' [bench press] all of you! Then I'll fuck, like, 21 sluts!"
