V8
	(2004-12-31 +358/-95)
	A Combustian engine.  Called a V8 because it has 8 cylanders arranged in a "V" formation (if you look at it from the front or back), with 4 cylanders on each side.  Very common in [muscle cars] from the [60s] and early [70s], the V8 is still a popular motor among Domestic car enthusiasts.
		Example: Both the new [Ford Mustang] [GT] and [Chevrolet Corvette] have V8 engines.

	(2006-10-28 +172/-61)
	A real engine. Dosent matter if its [Chev], Dodge, Holden, Ford its gonna beat the shit out of a [fart-can] possesing turbo four cylinder. Think about it: You do the exact equivilent modifications to a v8 powerhouse and to a 4 cylinder [fart-box] you will always get more horses out of the v8. Its simple maths. More cylinders= More Displacement.
		Example: I love it when i scream past a wanker in a 4 cylinder [hatchback] with a 10 inch [tacho] and 36 inch exhaust, and scare the absolute shit out of him, with my Holden [ute], powered by a quality Australian V8.

	(2005-08-15 +358/-186)
	A kick-ass powerfull engine. Ricers usually tend to flap about how in-effiecient [V8's] (of the 70's) were. Actually, they were in-efficient only because the lack of technology, now, with new modern muscle cars coming out, such as the Charger and the Mustang, these cars actually compete with [Honda's] little 4-bangers for [MPG]. V8's have 8 cylinders arranged in a V pattern, these produce monster amounts of torque and HP, killing rice like no tommorow. [New Mustang's] have twice the cylinders and about three times the displacement as the Honda Civic, yet still gets 30 MPG highway. Take that, rice burner.
		Example: [V8's] [will] [smoke your ass].

	(2005-10-16 +103/-53)
	A recipricating machine consiting of eight cylinders in the "V" configuration,introduced in the 30's more efficient [V8's] are introduced with every generation. Pre 1975 V8's were high compression engines that could run 115 octane gas and produce 3-400 ft lbs of torque and 3-400 horsepower.Post 1975 V8's were low compression engines that ran on lower octane unleaded fuel and were less powerfull but didnt disperse as much lead into the air. In the recent generation V8's that utilize [fuel injection] are more effiecent combusting devices and still produce sufficient power. As the 2000's lead on smaller displacement V8's are more powerful than previous big displacement engines. Computer modules help effientcy of V8's (and any other engine) with emissions,gas mileage, and constant performance. Ignorant people tend to say " [look under the hood] of your 2005 dodge hemi so many wires and [computer bullshit] that means more problems compare it to my 67' bronco 302 it has [starer] wires and a gas [line it] is so much more [relible].screw all of that computer shit" they say this because not only do they not know anything about a car or how to fix one, they do not realize the fact that if older cars were so good then how come carboraters still arent around on cars? how come we still arent producing the model T? oh wait a minute its called TECHNOLOGY and efficientcy. Most other ignorant people tend to think V8's should stop production because the are "gas hogs" if thats the case lets put a 1.5 [4 banger] in 1 ton trucks. Take a look at the 5.7 litre dodge hemi with MDS (multiple displacement system)
	it has the potential of 20 + mpg and still has awesome power. its because in low rpm situations such as [highway driving], lower oil pressure shuts down  eight hydralic lifters shutting down 4 cylinders which has a great benifit for gas mileage. its good on gas and is a powerful monster. most rice burner wiggers tend to think 1.5 litre 4 [cyl] motors with a lot of [juice can] win any race. but its all aftermarket add on bullshit.take a jeep WK with a hemi and it would beat the shit out of a honda civic. hell a jeep [WJ] with a 4.7 cant beat the shit out of a honda civic 4 banger. Excuse me a jeep [XJ] with a 4.0 litre I-6 can beat any rice burner on the street. a hemi is more powerful out of the box than any supra. period. 
		Example: WIGGER: dawg if i put $5000 worth of nitrous in my car it will have power.
		MECHANIC:your car isnt designed for speed or power. its ment to get 40 [mpg]. you'll burn holes in your pistons.
		it ill [void your warranty] and your parents will be pissed that you fucked there car up
		WIGGER:screw you dealership im goin to johnny independant

v8 killer
	(2008-09-18 +66/-52)
	Something the guy below knows nothing about. First off, it would take a ludicrous sum of money for an Eclipse to beat a viper. Secondly, Vipers have TEN cylinders. I'm not going to say [v8] killers don't exist. They do. But not in the form of an eclipse (unless the owner puts so much money into the car that the final cost is as much as if not more than a car with a v8). Stock v8 killers include the [Subaru WRX STI], the Mitsubishi EVO (not the eclipse), the [Toyota Supra] (MK IV only) and a few others. Don't get me wrong. I'm not saying that you can't modify a four - banger to meet or beat a v8. I'm just saying that in most cases doing so is a waste of time and money.
		Example: Kid with a civic: Yo dude I got me a v8 killer!
		Me: Wanna prove it?
		Civic kid: Yo dawg yeah les go right now!
		(I beat him in a stock [Chevy Blazer] that doesn't even have a v8)
		Civic Kid: Yo dawg do you have that v8 on nawws? 
		Me: It's a v6 dumbass...
		
		Different kid, Different Civic: Dude my Honda is so fast, I raced one of them new GTOs the other day and smoked it!
		Me (laughing on the inside): I'll race you in my Jeep...
		Civic Kid 2: Won't even be a close race, save your gas.
		Me: I know it's not going to be close...but I'm going to race you anyway.
		Civic Kid 2: OK but don't cry to me when you lose
		I beat this civic in a Jeep Cherokee (XJ) with a 4.0 and [5 speed] transmission. The kid in the Civic looks a little stunned.
		Civic kid 2: Yo man I just remembered that my battery is going bad so that's probably why I lost.
		Me: ....[what the fuck ever]...

	(2006-10-16 +37/-110)
	a slang term given to slow cars (ex- 4 [cylinder] [import]) that have been highly modified to be faster than [V8] beasts (ex- corvettes, vipers, etc).

		viperguy: [v8] baby. more power than that piece of shit will ever see
		tunerkid: lets see about it.

va te faire foutre
	(2004-04-14 +895/-204)
	[French] [expletive], meaning go "[fuck yourself]".
		Example: A: [Voulez-vous coucher avec moi]?
		B: [Va te faire foutre]!

	(2006-04-15 +328/-92)
	Literally, 'Go do / make yourself.' One of the most vulgar forms of dismissal in [the French language]. To execute the gesture, [make a fist] with the right hand, and extend the arm out straight, parallel to the ground, fingers up. With the left hand open, slap the right bicep just above the elbow while raising the right forearm upwards to 90 degrees. Known as the 'Bras d'honneur.'
	
	Roughly equivalent to fuck off, go fuck yourself, [up yours], etc.
		Example: While stopped at a red light, the person behind you honks their horn for you to move. You give them the Bras d'honneur, and shout through the [open window], 'Va te faire [foutre], [putain] d'esp√®ce d'encul√©!'

	(2004-01-18 +175/-75)
	[French] [insult]: 'fuck you'
		Example: [Va te faire foutre] encul√© !

	(2006-12-24 +184/-56)
	"Fuck you" or, more literally, "Go fuck yourself"
	
	This is the correct [conjugation] of the verb 'aller' because this is an [imperative] sentence.  The imperative form of 'aller' in the second person is 'va.'  I had to clarify this because there is another definition on this site, where the author vehemently states that it is 'Vas te [faire] foutre' and that is pretty obviously incorrect (for anybody who got past the first week of French 101).
		Example: Tu n'es qu'un con...va te faire foutre, putain de connard!
		
		fous le camp, fiche-moi la [paix], [va te faire enculer], tu me fais chier, [je t'emmerde]

	(2014-04-01 +23/-8)
	'Go fuck yourself' in French (singular)
	
	Alternatively "[Allez] vous faire [foutre]" for strangers or more than one person
	(Translation: Go fuck yourselves)
	
	NB Contrary to the belief of others, 'Va' is in fact the correct conjugation of 'aller' in this context, as while it is in second person (usually 'tu [vas'] = you go), the s is dropped in the imperative form.
		Example: Marie: Tu es une [salope].
		
		(You are a bitch/slut)
		
		[Fran√ßoise]: [Va te faire foutre]!

	(2017-10-02 +34/-18)
	A [common] [greeting] in [France]
		Example: [Guy 1]: [Bonjour] !
		[Guy 2]: Vas te faire foutre !

	(2005-03-23 +66/-297)
	"Go fuck yourself", or "Fuck you" in French.
	
	[Va te faire foutre] is spelt INCORRECTLY. The conjugation for [Aller] (to go) in French for tu (which is the assumed pronoun, as the reflexive is using te se [foutre] is a reflexive verb) is Vas NOT Va which is the conjugation for il/elle/qui/on (he/she/who/one)
		Example: Vas [te] faire foutre!
		[Tabarnack], man, [je] te deteste!

	Players who have been banned always claim they didn't cheat, or their brother or friend put the hacks on, basically trying to get it out. There have only been less than 10 people actually [unbanned] from VAC before. Anyone who is banned will only be banned from VAC secure servers, but can still play on [unsecured] ones. Every game that uses VAC will be inaccessible (you won't be able to play on VAC secure servers).
	
	It's often criticized as a way to make money from Valve to get a new account and games. Accounts that have been banned payed up to thousands on games before, but over 1 hack they loose all.
	
	Many times VAC isn't updated to the most recent hacks, private hacks still exist, and are harder to detect.
	
	VAC has certainly busted many cheaters, but some still get by.
		Example: Noob: OMG! Me is VAC banned! WTF! [vavle] u just want my [monies]! I didtn [hack]!
		
		Me: God shut up. We all know you hacked, headshots 24/7 isn't easy, but you managed to do it. Go away.

		Example: - I am traveling through [Siberia] to [Mongolia], if I use 2 or 4 months getting there, I don't care.
		- Oh, you're such a [vacilando]!

vague date
	(2007-05-14 +60/-2)
	A phrase coined by [Teresa Strasser] of [the Adam] Carolla Show on Free FM which refers to social outings that would normally be considered dates, but where one of the two people involved seems completely oblivious to the concept of dating. This is generally characterized by a lack of interest in conversation or flirting, an [aimless] absence of direction or goals for the evening, and possibly an uncomfortable revelation that the event was never intended to be date. This can be blamed on the modern tendency for self-absorption and a narcissistic belief that you shouldn't have to put forth any effort to be interesting or even pleasant.
		Example: I ended up going on a vague date with Jim. We went and saw a stupid buddy comedy and ate at Starbucks, but he split when he got [a phone call] from a friend to [play basketball].
		
		[I don't even know] if the date I was on with Nancy was a date, because she kept talking to me about how great it was to be single. I think it was some weird vague date.

	Valentine's Day Heartbreak is an emotional state of hardship for single,depressed, lonely,and emotionally confused people. This is the time of year when all the [lovebirds] of the world make other people feel terribly [unloved] and socially unwanted by parading around school with their $5.00 balloons, pink-and-red teddy bears, and assorted chocolate candies that they will eat in front of single people and never offer to share. Mainstream corporate businesses that are extremely [insensitive] toward other people's feelings are the forces behind [peddling] this type of garbage. Since Valentine's Day Heartbreak occurs, all the emotionally inconsiderate and insensitive jerks who celebrate this holiday should keep all of their twisted, manufactured icons of "true love" to themselves.   
		Example: A conversation between an insensitive loser and a person who suffers from Valentine's Day Heartbreak:
		Person 1([basking] in their "greatness"): "I'm so special! I have 3 balloons, 4 [red roses], and 5 teddy bears...Everyone loves me!....What did you get?

	Home to the largest Porn industry in the world (see [chatsworth]), the worlds most used road ([the 101] freeway) and so much more. The valley is said to be where the excessive use of the word "like" first originated, but the rest of teen america seems to have picked that up now too.

		Example: L.A. people constantly [bad mouth] the valley, but every time it tries to become it's own city, they vote that shit down, cus they know how much they need the [bundles] of money the [SFV] brings in to keep their over-populated schools, over-used roads and everything else running

	A place where it is impossible to go anywhere without running [into someone] you know. The girls are the sluttiest. Make one [phone call], and you can have any drug within ten minutes.

		Example: it may not be [new york city], but its [certainly] [interesting].

	(2005-01-12 +118/-80)

	To those of us from New England, "[The Valley]" most often refers to the [Merrimack Valley], a bi-state area along the [Merrimack] River. Most of [the Valley] is suburban. The largest cities are [Haverhill], MA, Lawrence, MA, Lowell, MA, [Nashua], NH, Manchester, NH, and [Concord, NH]. All of these cities are former mill towns powered by the river.
	
	If you live in the Merrimack Valley region, chances are you tell everyone you're from the "Boston Area", have a Boston accent, and cheer for all the Boston sports teams, even though Boston is an hour away. About half the people in your high school graduating class went to drug rehab before the age of 18. Unless your zip code is 01810, 05501, 01899, 01921, 01985, 01886, 03110, 03031, 03049, or 03087, you are working class/poor. Chances are, if you are from the working-class areas you pretend to be rich, while if you are from the rich areas you pretend to be "ghetto". Ethnic pride is high in The Valley. You will see more Irish, Italian, Canadian, Lebanese, Cambodian, Brazilian, Puerto Rican, and Dominican flags than American ones, though almost every other street is named for a KIA war soldier.
	
	All in all, The Valley is a place of contradictions, not to mention a shitty place to live and an even shittier place to say you're from.
		Example: Situation #1:
		
		Angie: I'm from the Boston Area.
		
		Milly: Wonderful! Where in Boston?
		
		Angie: [Methuen].
		
		Milly: Hmmmm that's funny. I live in Boston and have never heard of any place in the city called Methuen.
		
		Angie: Ughh, actually, it's in The Valley. And it's not Andover, [Boxford], or Windham.
		
		Milly: Ew! Do you live in a slum? Are your kids potheads? Do you shop at [Marshall's]? DO YOU SPEAK FLUENT ENGLISH?!
		
		Angie: What?
		
		Situation #2:
		
		Ryan: Yo, yo, I rep The Valley.
		
		Santos: Sweet man. What part?
		
		Ryan: Amherst.
		
		Santos: Shit man, you ain't ghetto! You probably live in a colonial mansion. Try living in [Nashua] with a drug bust or gang fight outside your house every ten minutes.
		
		Ryan: No way homie. Am-town has way more oxy and e than [Trashua], cause we have the bank to buy all our shit off you!

		3: [Dracula] owns.

	(2007-10-10 +478/-233)
	1. In literature, media, and folklore, a "traditional" vampire is a demon who consumes blood of humans or animals for [nourishment]. Sometimes a human who has been bit by a vampire will transform into a vampire themselves. Vampires have a fear of anything holy, garlic, and the sun. Vampires have a child-like mentality, as they are unable to enter places or do certain things without permission, as was first addressed in [Bram Stoker's] "Dracula." Most commonly killed by a stake through the heart.
	
	2. Any species of bat that consumes blood. Three types of vampire bats are the Common [Vampire Bat] ([Desmodus] [rotundus]),  the Hairy Legged VB (Diphylla ecaudata), and the White-Winged VB (Diaemus [youngi]). They rarely attack humans and mostly consume blood from livestock or birds.
	
	3. Any member of the goth subculture who thinks that listening to Norwegian death metal, dressing in long black clothing, and being a fan of vampire movies and/or blood will make them a full-fledged vampire. Refuse to believe that vampires are just the work of folklore. Can usually be seen outside Hot Topic, alone, as nobody will be their friend because they "don't want to associate with the living."
		Example: 1. [Bram Stoker's] "[Dracula]" is considered the premiere text of vampire folklore.
		
		2. Vampire bats are common in tropical climates, barns, and [zoos].
		
		3. This was an actual example from someone I met at the mall who was claiming to be a vampire. They became my "source," so to speak.

		-That [clerk] is a vampire working [night shift] and sleeping throughout [day time].

	(2010-09-10 +35/-14)
	A friend of mine told me about the Origins of how [vampires] came from. It started off as that vampires were people with [rabies], you know [people bit] by animals that have rabies. These people with rabies foam their mouth, act animal-like into terms of bite other animals or humans in the neck, sucking blood from two holes created by their [fangs]. Like to live in darkness because they either developed a pupil or [retina] capable of nocturnal vision or just like darkness.
	
	They are afraid of light, obviously because it can nearly blind their vision to see, they like to see in darkness or their eyes are not adjust to the sensitivity of light. Some examples are shining metals or objects, mirrors, and sources of light(like the sun). They are afraid of water because they either want to stay dry, [hypothermia], or hygiene issues.
	
	Now I don't know how people with rabies can grow fangs that can be of 2 inches or more...The religious things tide into destroying vampires...well, I don't know how that got started but light can kill vampires, I think.
	
	[Vampires] may originate from people contacted with rabies, not sure if that's the case, but you may prove my information is nonsense or dislike opinion.
	
	The transformation of [the bat], I don't know how that came from. Not all vampires are evil.
		Example: [Vampires] from [twilight saga] are not real [vampires].
		
		First of all, vampires don't really have red eyes(you can prove it to me scientifically), they are supposed to morph into bats and become quick killers. Any sources of light seem to not affect them or kill them, they seemed [impervious] to light. Lastly, I don't know if vampires have powers or not maybe they do.
		
		Vampires are respected and feared, but twilight saga has made them an insult to their kind.

[Vampire bites] on the stomach require moving, (or removing) ones shirt, and is best done while the receiving partner is lying down. For these reasons, they are best done in private.
	
	Vampire bites can be given anywhere on the body, but neck, chest, and stomach are the most common. Avoid rashes, cuts, and on the face.
	
	b) Biting: The part that makes this a vampire bite, and not just a hickey. Bite the area chosen gently the first time. Try slowly biting harder and harder as you proceed. Many people receive more pleasure the harder they are bitten, but people that don't, could get very angry if [you bite] them too hard, so be careful. Once you know, try to bite them as hard as you can without [hurting them], or breaking skin, if they show a sign of discomfort [ease up], if they like it, try (VERY GENTLY) grinding your teeth on their skin, many [dislike this], but people who do, will find this incredibly arousing.
	
	c) Sucking: This isn't necessary, but is important if you want to leave a mark. You would just suck on their skin until it leaves a bruise. Same as you would a hickey. If your partner is one who gets more pleasure out of more pain, suck as hard and as long as you can.
	
	d) Kissing: Kissing makes it more gentle and can [soften the blow] of a painful bite. Kiss the area very gently before [the bite] to make it more shocking, and more pleasurable. Licking the area, like a [French kiss] to the skin, can make it sexier and ease the pain more.
	
	e) Finishing: The last thing you should do to the bite is kiss it, after you have many options what to do. A more romantic way, is to move, or move your head, and look your partner in the eyes, see if they enjoyed it. A sexier way, especially if done on a lower part of the body (stomach or lower) is to kiss them slowly all over until you reach their lips, and proceed to kiss them however you want.
	
	(But there's no real way to finish off)
	
	A good order to follow: (not including a and e)
	Kiss, Bite, Suck, Kiss, Bite, Kiss.
		Example: 1. Person 1: Hey look I just got my [vampire bite] done!
		Person 2: Wow, you're so [scenexcore]!
		
		2. A large [spider bite].
		
		3) "We were making out last night, and he gave me the biggest vampire bite ever! It was amazing!"

	(2009-07-03 +19/-12)
	To [give] [someone] a [hickey].
		Example: A man and a woman were [kissing] when the man gave [the woman] a [hickey]. That is a "Vampire Bite".

	(2008-02-26 +36/-18)
	A [piercing] placed on the left side of the neck a little below [the chin] to look as though you have been "bitten by a vampire." It's a very risky piercing because it's so close to the [artery]. Very unique piercing.
		Example: "Cool vampire bite [piercing]!" - [Reeses]
		
		"Thanks, I got it because no one else has it." - [Marie]

	(2008-01-03 +759/-200)
	A killer band from a killer city (New York), who fuse together a seemingly [unheard] of combination of instruments to pretty much [make there] own genre: "[The Upper West Side Soweto]".
		Example: "Dude the [debut] album of [Vampire Weekend] is coming out in [3 days]"
		
		"Lets go wait in line"

	(2013-03-01 +28/-32)
	A multiple day [sex binge] with a girl while she is on her period. Going to a concert as [opening act] is optional as is it being an actual weekend. Some people insist oral sex on her is a requirement. Others ([Van Helsing] crowd) say simply staking her repeatedly and a bloody mess is all that is required, even going as far as to suggest deflowerings be included as vampire weekends.
		Example: Yeah I am taking Katie to [Vale] on our [honeymoon] - but looks like it will be a [Vampire Weekend].

	(2010-01-24 +49/-85)
	A weekend that "sucks" you of energy and leaves [you tired] for Monday. Depending on what happened this could be a [positive or negative] occurrence, often both, but generally has an air of regret or [hardship].
		Example: My presentation at the office is going to be terrible thanks to another vampire weekend spent [clubbing] with Joe and the gang.
		
		I will be screwed if I [have another] vampire weekend with [final exams] coming up next week.

	(2008-02-14 +90/-281)
	The period of time that a [schticky] "it" band is popular for, typically 1-3 months, or enough time to release an album and complete a worldwide tour.  Think "[fifteen minutes] of fame," but for an [indy rock] band instead of a person.
		Example: [Junior Senior]?  Who's that?
		
		Oh, they're this [Danish] pop band that was popular for a vampire weekend back in [2003].

	(2010-02-28 +353/-153)
	One of the best bands of the moment. Have released two albums to date: "Vampire Weekend" and "Contra".
	
	Best songs include, in no particular order: "Giving up the Gun", "A-Punk", "[Mansard] Roof", "[Cape Cod Kwassa Kwassa]", "I stand corrected", "M79", "Cousins", "The Kids don't Stand a Chance".
	
	Vampire Weekend consists of four guys, Ezra Koenig (main singer, guitar), Rostam Batmanglij (keyboards), Chris Tomson (drums) and [Chris Baio] (bass guitar).
		Example: The guys from Vampire Weekend met when they were studying in [Columbia].
		
		Their awesome music is influenced by [reggae], [ska] and afro-pop.

	(2012-03-19 +77/-29)
	A terrific Indie Rock band. Vampire Weekend established their unique and unlikely sound on their debut album, which combined punk with classical, new wave, and worldbeat music. The album was terrific, but even better is their 2nd album (Contra), which, while still containing their sound from their debut album, explores genres such as [synthpop], more 80's, ska, and reggae. Contra is a classic and arguably one of the greatest modern indie records ever made. They're also notable for their unique lyrics from [Ezra Koenig], using unique nouns in his songwriting to make it sound really cool.
	
	I am a huge Vampire Weekend fan, and when they announce a third album, I will freak out. They are one of the best bands ever, and will continue to impact [mainstream indie] rock with every album they release.
		Example: Every Vampire Weekend [band member] is extremely talented and all of their songs (including [Ottoman]) are awesome! Get their albums today!
		
		Obama is using Vampire Weekend songs for his [campaign]? That might actually make me want to vote for him!

	(2008-07-11 +203/-106)
	A [vampire weekend] is one in which you are [staying up] late, throughout the night and either not sleeping at all or [catching up on sleep] during the day time. Basically you are more active at night then the day.
		Example: Dude our [vampire weekend] so much fun, but [i'm going to sleep] for [a couple] days

	(2010-03-07 +356/-243)
	[Debatably] the best band of all time. Albums: Vampire Weekend and Contra ([new release]). Band met at [Columbia University], and has been playing for a few years.
		Example: [Lets go] [buy] Vampire Weekend [tickets]!

	(2010-06-12 +20/-10)
	(noun) - A teacher who, during last period [on a friday], assigns [a project] or [a shitload of] homework due next monday, effectively killing any chances of having fun during the weekend.
		Example: David: Man this weekend is gonna be crazy! Ready to rock bro?
		
		Bro: Nah man, my history teacher gave me a long [ass project] due monday.
		
		David: Damn, [sucks to be you]!
		
		Bro: Yeah, Mrs. [Karla] is a real weekend vampire!

		Example: yo that vampire's lunch box was ill [wid] all [dose] bloody [rags]

_____

vampirefreaks
	(2013-05-29 +84/-18)
	A good idea gone bad. Was a place for open-minded alternative peoples, goths/punks/metalheads/etc, to post a profile and find similar people. Now exists as a slightly darker facebook alternative for emo/scene children, the retarded offspring of any and all of the above subcultures, now with [fringes]. Also a disturbing number of fake profiles clearly created by middle-aged perverts, most of them written in broken foreign English, but claiming to be from either the US or UK.
	
	You will be added as a friend by people who never even attempt to speak to you. Users can be rated [1-10], a fantastic addition to a site used by people who are all about not judging people and don't care what you think. The ratings feature can be switched off, however, but of course it never is. Any messages you do get will consist of "10" or "10+" or "hi, here's a 10, please rate back"
	
	Sentences like "I hate ignorance and hypocrisy" can be found on every profile, usually followed by something ignorant and hypocritical concerning all the people and things they hate.
	
	Occasionally, one will find rare red diamonds such as, "I don't like people who are needlessly promiscuous. I'd much prefer [intelligent conversation] to sex." Usually on the about me sections of fat ugly [pseudo-intellectual] [gobshites] who can't get sex so attempt to mask this by claiming they never wanted it in the first place.
		Example: [Ten years] ago vampirefreaks was a reasonable place to waste a few [idle] hours online. Now just [a complete waste] of time.

	(2006-06-24 +256/-96)
	[Vampirefreaks] is a website originally for the alternative, cyber goths, goths, freaks etc..though i must say, many emos have joined as well. [Fuckthemainstream] is a section of [vampirefreaks] which enables people to purchase their alternative clothing and accesories. However the main reason people go on [vf] is to create a personal profile, join cults which interest them and socialize.    
		Example: 1. [Vampirefreaks] aka [Vf] is a hardcore version of myspace.
		2. Boo, that  [premium] whore gave me a rating of 1.

	(2006-08-25 +56/-25)
	Web page where you create a profile that other users [read in] order for them to rate you fairly YEAAAAAH RIGHT if by "read" you mean go directly to the [gallery] and by "fairly" u mean [how cute] are or how "sexy" u look... mostly of the time ppl only rate "10" and leave comments like "You Look Like A Hottie..I Luv Ur Hair...*10*" that crearly shows you didn't pay much attention to what they wrote on their profile but don't worry if u don't [like to talk] about yourself u can just put lots of photos about you posing and that's it! *Lots of comments and rates by girls* saying you're so hot or so sexy you know since nobody actually reads profiles... also an alternative from myspace.com 
		Example: [Vampirefreaks] at some point might have been Good but [nowadays] is just a [popularity contest] 

	(2010-05-24 +79/-23)
	A social networking website for those of a altnernative, industrial, gothic culture ect, though it is mainly full of emos ,[scene kids], attentionwhores and [perverts].
	
	Users usually claim to be "themselves" and hate trends and [labels], when they pretty much all look the same anyway. Because they are so immensly original.
	
	Rather than being about music and culture, [vampirefreaks] is or perhaps has become more of a place based on image and trend. It is full of a countless number of pointless cults, and not to mention attentionwhores of both genders who feed of trashy comments of the opposite sex.
	
	User profiles often consist of
	
	- a [passage] about how different they are. And how they want others to percive them. Or how much of a bitch or trashy they are and how they are proud of it.
	-picture of the user, commonly- a girl in a weird angle or a guy lifting his shirt or showing of his stomach.
	-likes and dislikes
	-sometimes little emo [gifs] and pictures.
		Example: person 1 : hai i joined [vampirefreaks] cos im [so dark] and alternative.
		person 2 : you dont need a site to determine who you are as a person.
		person 1: OMG i got soo many points this week.
		person 2: heres a gold medal.
		
		vfperson : heyy welcome to [vf], 10+ your hawt ;) (but i just want you to give me points back and i'll hardly talk you ever again hehe)
		
		person1 : 10+ thanks & hi (omggg they think im hawt ! *creams* )

	(2008-11-15 +101/-38)
	A community website similar to myspace or facebook that was originally intended for the gothic/industrial subculture and those who take part in it, but it has recently become flooded with scene and emo kids and those generally annoying people who only create profiles to post 'glamour pics' and look at other people who have 'glamour pics'. The site has a feature where users are able to rate each other on a scale of 1 - 10 and  but usually people rate based on the person's pictures, never mind actually getting to know the person or even read the profile [god forbid], and the [comment's] usually consist of 'nice pics cutie' or 'OMGZ ur like [s0] h0tt ;)'. [But of course] there are some people on there who are not complete vain and material idiots. Those can often be found in certain areas of the messageboards.
		Example: Vampirefreaks is a site where those who relate with the [gothic] and [industrial] [subculture] can gather
		
		Vampirefreaks has become infested with silly emo and scene kids...why the fuck do I keep going back?

	(2004-07-21 +77/-36)
	A [gothic] [chatroom] [community].
		Example: Not [vampires] who are [freaks].

	(2009-09-04 +56/-26)
	A networking website for Goths. It was created by the king of bats, Jet. This website is affiliated with a clothing company called [Fuckthemainstream], which is ironic because VampireFreaks continues to attract more and more emo and scene kids (who all shop at Hot Topic) everyday, even to the point of letting My Chemical Romance create a [VF] profile. Profiles include a profile rating system, which seperates the cool & popular goths from the uncool & unpopular goths, even though all goth kids supposedly 'don't give a shit' about being popular.
	
	If you want access to the entire site or other privilages, you have to pay for a premium account, which is pointless because what can possibly be cool enough on that site that you'd have to pay to access it? Oh yeah, adding moar music to your already shitty playlist of nothing but [Combichrist] and Mindless Self-Indulgence songs. Also, with a premium account, your photo album can hold at least twice the capacity of photos of yourself crying [fake blood] and [grayscale] images of dead and/or bloody roses.
	
	VampireFreaks has opened up a clothing outlet in New York, which will then be made into a chain of stores, and then turn into another Hot Topic; thus defeating it's own purpose as a non-mainstream company.
		Example: VampireFreaks is a [mediocre] [website].

	(2007-06-26 +87/-56)
	A [Gothic] Industrial Culture for all races,13 years of age and up,where there is a [1-10 rating] system,it is a darker and more [sinister] version of MySpace and there is a better Contact Support involved.
		Example: Girl:[Hey you] got a VampireFreaks account?
		Boy:No [what's that]?
		Girl:It's really awesome,you'd like it there.
		Boy:Well [sign] me up,i want to see what this is about.

	(2011-04-23 +26/-36)
	Another [social networking] [website] especially designed for [attention whores].
		Example: [everyone] that uses [vampirefreaks] is [dumb]

	(2005-05-08 +49/-90)
	1. A person who is a member of the site [vampirefreaks] [dot com]. It's another website for shallow morons who have nothing better to do then follow trends and use the word "pseudo" far too often.
	
	2. A [Yahoo Messenger] chat room under the category of music.
		Example: VFboi22882283: i wnna [suck] ur [bluud]. and im not a [poser]

Vampires Suck
	(2010-09-11 +55/-20)
	A movie that well... kind of sucked. Based on the previews, it really didn't look bad. Anything that has dancing [werewolves] and a spoof about some of those insane [team Edward]/Jacob fans can't be too bad, right? Wrong. This movie is only 80 minutes, but it feels much longer. The movie drags on, and the plot is just random. It has a few good moments that make you laugh, but for the most part, you just want it to end. It doesn't even matter if you love or hate Twilight. Both Twilight lovers and haters could have enjoyed this movie. Instead, lovers hate it because it doesn't even make sense, and haters hate it because it is a lame parody of Twilight. Overall, it is [a complete waste] of time and money. Enjoy.
		Example: Boy #1: "Vampires Suck? Isn't that the movie that makes fun of [Twilight]? I want to see it!"
		
		Boy #2: "Yeah, well Vampires Suck sucks even more than [Edward Cullen] with a [sippy cup] of blood!"

	(2010-08-05 +63/-40)
	Another one of those [spoof] movies made by the same guys who made [Meet the Spartans] , [Disaster Movie] and etc but this time attacking The Twilight series . If you've seen Meet the Spartans and/or Disaster Movie, You know this movie is going to be shit. No I hate Twilight so I am not defending it.
		Example: Friend 1: Hey man want to see a movie?
		
		Friend 2: Sure, what is it?
		
		Friend 1: [Vampires suck], it's made by the same guys who made [Disaster movie] and [Meet the Spartans]. It's going to be funny!
		
		Friend 2: I hate you GTFO of my sight.

	(2010-08-10 +46/-61)
	The most epic spoof movie to come out this summer. For all the people who are tired of the stupid "[Team Jacob]" or "[Team Edward]" b.s.
	
	[Tagline]: "From the guys that couldn't sit through another vampire movie"
		Example: Person 1: [What are you doing] on [August 18th]?
		[Person 2]: Watching Vampires Suck

	(2010-09-06 +39/-51)
	the most awesome movie out! makes [twilight] look like crap! if you haven't [seen it] your [missing out]!

vampirism
	(2006-08-23 +159/-34)
	[Vampirism] is the disease/ability described many ways throughout history creating Vampires. The main concept for [vampirism] can be someone who is drinking the blood of humans or animals, or someone draining [the psychic] [energies] of somebody else. Many sources tell of several accompanying attributes like fangs, pale skin, mild to severe [allergy] to sunlight, silver and garlic. Stories tell of ability to fly, [shapeshift], about the need of coffins, [immortality] and vampires being living dead. 
	
	Many of these beliefs are myth or fiction but there lives a society claiming to be real vampires today, and they assert the following:
	
	Vampirism is the disease or abilities related to vampires.
	Vampirism can be conducted two ways. Either someone is turned (created by another vampire), or [awakened] (become one by him/herself in time). When someone shows the symptoms of being sensitive to sunlight, prefering to be awake during the night, having very acute senses, and instincts, somewhat resistant to common illness.. as well as having a thirst/hunger nothing seems to be able to ease, and an easily triggered 'secondary personality' the beast, who is violent, very [temperamental], and impatient. V
	
	Related to this community, vampirism DOESN'T mean immortality, death when contacting garlic, silver, or sunlight, blood tears, consumption of nothing but blood, sacred symbols are not lethal to- nor feared by vampires, they do show up in mirrors, they dont heal instantly, they are not all pale, not all beautiful, they're not all evil, and they dont live a secluded life away from human society.
		Example: [A friend] of [mine] [conducted] vampirism.

	(2011-05-11 +28/-2)
	[The vampire] legend comes from the the Greek Mythological creature, Empusa, which is a creature that has the upper body of a ghost, a leg of a donkey, and a leg of bronze. Empusa fed [on the blood] of young men, creating [the vampire] legend. So therefore, vampires do NOT sparkle. Those are fairies.

Dracula is a name based off the Order of the Dragon, or Order of [Dracul], which Bram Stoker used as his vampiric character based loosely on Vlad the Impaler.

	During the year without summer (1816) in which Mary & Percy Shelly, Clair [Clairmont], [Lord Byron], and John [Polidori] were gathered at the Villa [Diodati], Switzerland; Lord Byron suggested, on one night, that each should write a horror story.
	
	During that night, Polidori began writing a short tale which would become the first vampire story ever written in the english language, titled: "The Vampyre."
	
	It should also be noted that during that same night, Mary Shelley started working on a story which would later evolve into the famous novel "Frankenstein."
		Example: [Polidori's] story "The Vampyre" is a short story which was, at first, was falsely credited to Lord Byron. Nevertheless, it was later confirmed by Byron that the author was in fact John William [Polidori] ([Lord Byron's] physician).

Van Halen
	(2004-03-19 +1136/-189)
	One of the greatest bands of all time. This band redefined the term of shredding and good fuckin' Rock and Roll. I love them in a very hedero way and Eddie Van Halens influence on todays [guitar players] such as me is extremely strong. Other bands such as POD, Sum 41 and Blink 182 should bow down to Van Halen because Van Halen is such a better band then those poor,low fuckin' excuses for a rock and roll band. Such rockin' songs by Van Halen were Runnin' With the Devil, Panama, [Hot For Teacher], Ain't Talkin' Bout' Love, and the ultimite example of [Eddies] excellence of playing, is Eruption. Probably the greatest [1:32] seconds of any Van Halen fans life. That song is like orgasmic! Overall Van Halen is one of the best Rock and Roll bands of all time and will get their place in the Rock and Roll Hall Of Fame. Next year baby! They will get in!!
		Example: Person 1: [Hey dude] [whats] that [awsome] fuckin music??

	(2010-11-02 +77/-18)
	Van Halen is one of the greatest rock bands of all time. The main line-up consisted of Eddie and Alex Van Halen on guitar and drums and [Michael Anthony] on bass. They started out with David Lee Roth as singer then Sammy [Hagar], then [Gary Cherone], Hagar again and now back to Roth. Anthony left and Eddie's son Wolfgang Van Halen is the bassist. They have had a lot of great songs like Jump, Hot for Teacher, When It's Love, Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love, Right Now, Dance the Night Away, and of course the greatest solo of alltime, ERUPTION! There are many people who think that when Hagar replaced Roth that they became terrible and that "[Van Hagar]" was never as good as [the Roth] years. I say suck it. Both singers were really good. They brought the band to places they wouldn't be before. Hagar gave them four #1 albums. Don't say he's not good. I personally like Roth better but they were both great. Besides, would you rather have had the 10 years with Hagar or 10 years with Gary Cherone? Didn't think so.
		Example: [VH] fan 1: Hey what's your favorites song by Van Halen?
		VH fan 2: Mine favorites are When It's Love and Dreams.
		VH fan 1: That's cool. I'm more of a Roth guy, so mine are Panama and Mean Street.
		VH fan 2: They're good songs.

In the early 80s they band started fighting because the band thought [Diamond Dave] (a kickass jew and lead singer) was acting like that Van Halen was Just his backup band and its all about him. So Diamond Dave left the band in 1985. And then...They had to get a new lead singer and that was [Sammy Hagar] a horrible singer people thought the band was done because of his voice. songs like "Why cant this be love" And "dreams" sounded like freaking pop music. But the band stayed alive for over a decade (the only reason the band stayed alive is because of Eddies kickass guitar playing) Well now Sammy is kicked out of the band and [van halen] is planning a 2007 summer tour with [david lee roth] (rumored)

Vancouver Canucks
	(2011-06-16 +122/-43)
	A name that will now forever be synonymous with [hockey] [hooliganism] to the great [unwashed masses] of non-hockey fans!
		Example: The Vancouver Canucks fans would have rioted [regardless] of whether they won or lost [the Stanley Cup] [Finals]!

	(2008-08-02 +326/-144)
	A NHL franchise that anually dissapoints their fans with [shabby] playoff showings and promises of glory next year.. Also the only professional sports team whos greatest accomplishments are almost winning a championship twice.. [Canuck fans] turn to [rioting] and looting in the face of defeat as a man can only take his team loosing for around 35 years before he snaps..
		Example: [Canuck] fan.. Ya well remember the [vancouver canucks] 94 cup run? we almost had it, we got robbed. [Mark Messier] is a douche..

	(2006-07-13 +202/-109)
	Vancouver [BC's] NHL franchise established in 1970.  Since their inception in the NHL, the Vancouver [Canucks] have had more ups and downs than most NHL franchises, but their fan base remains strong through thick and thin.  From 1970-1995 they played in the ([PNE]) Pacific [Coliseum] and from 1995-Present they have been playing at General Motors Place.  
	
	Although they have had many [underwhelming] seasons, the Canucks have made it to the Stanley Cup Finals on two occasions.  Once during the 1981/1982 season and more recently during the 1993/1994 season.  Ironically enough on both occasions they lost in the finals to a New York team (in 1982 they were swept in four games by The New York Islanders and in 1994 they had a dramatic and intense seven game series against the New York Rangers).  
	
	The Canucks were a dominant force in the NHL for most of the early 1990s and for the 2002/2003 and 2003/2004 regular seasons, they were arguably the best team in the NHL.    
		Example: Go! [Canucks]! Go!
		
		The future is uncertain for The Vancouver Canucks in the 2006/[2007] [season].
		
		

	(2003-12-31 +317/-200)

	(2010-02-04 +50/-177)
	[Canada's] best [NHL] team, and the best in the NHL. Won [the Stanley Cup] in 2009/2010 season.

	(2004-03-30 +89/-118)
	a cool team, that would be contending for the '04 cup right now, but [Bertuzzi] had to be an asshole and lose his temper; they'll lose in the playoffs w/o him, since [Naslund] is [banged up] right now
		Example: The [Canucks] are [cool]

Concerned with money and very superficial, tends to date Asian gangsters who will buy them whatever they want.

vancouver
	(2006-09-05 +1682/-162)
	That city where if you own a house already, you can [sell it] and buy two of the same in Toronto, or three in [Calgary], or an entire street in [Winnipeg].
		Example: My mouldy 1200 square foot [bungalow] in Vancouver costs [one million dollars] because it's got [a yard].  [A yard] with trees?  That'll be a million-two.

	(2006-09-08 +622/-100)
	That city where the average house price in the metropolitan region is now $[699],000 as of august 2006, and where one in three houses for sale is listed at over a million dollars.  [Torontonians] who move here usually end up downsizing from a 4 bedroom house in the city to a 2 bedroom condo or [townhome] 3 hours from downtown.
		Example: Sells toronto house for $378,000.  Heads to Vancouver and looks around...
		
		Richmond: $[658],000
		Surrey: $[544],000
		Burnaby: $680,000

	(2006-08-31 +295/-72)
	Beamerville.  The highest concentration of luxury cars and souped up civics you'll find outside of LA.  Offers the best seafood in the world at good prices.  Downtown consists of 99% condo towers and [marinas].  Very nice and all, but make sure you avoid the [DTES] next door (Downtown Eastside)!  Real estate on the west half of the city will cost both your arms and legs as well as those of your children and grand children.  Ownership of a home starts at [one million dollars].  Have fun paying off the mortgage.
		Example: "I drive around the parking lot at Aberdeen Centre in Vancouver and can only find BMWs and [Mercedes benz]..."
		
		"You can't find [sashimi] like this anywhere outside Vancouver"
		
		"[Sonofabitch]...I make 200k and I can't pay off my mortgage!  Vancouver sucks!!!"

	(2006-11-13 +245/-88)
	A gorgeous city nestled between the mountains and the ocean, that ranks on most years as the city with the best living standards in the world.  It's got the biggest per-capita health-care budget, best education standards, cleanest water, least pollution, healthiest lifestyles, sexiest moms, best seafood, and by far the most BMW's per capita for any city its size in the world.  But for property prices, let's just say you'll need to be able to afford two houses in Toronto before considering the [Vancouver] market.  It's also that place where people are perpetually drinking [lattes], doing yoga, skiing and [windsurfing] all at the same instant, while wearing those coveted lulumon pants.
	
	So why should anyone be surprised that Vancouver is more of a resort city than a head-office town.  Familes constantly go out to eat, and enjoy hiking, skiing or [kayaking] on weekends. Food is cheap, but just about everything else isn't.  Traffic is horrendous, and city council likes it that way so to make life difficult for businesses and force people to use bikes instead...resulting in the lowest percentage of private car trips in any North American city. Ironically car-ownership is highest in Canada at [2.3] cars per household...but nevermind that.
	
	Vancouver has its embarrassing roots as a [hippy town], where [Greenpeace] and adbusters once thrived. Though it has long since matured as a city, [funny things] still happen in Vancouver that don't happen in the rest of Canada, like foreign investors swapping condos that they've never lived in, teachers going on strike over wages that aren't higher than other provinces by a significant enough margin, environmental critics [fussing] over the best drinking water in the world, protecting mountain views by [restricting] building heights, immigrant families cooperating together to conceal [offshore] [incomes], or those awkward situations at the gardening shop when you wonder what the sign means when it says "Best pot selection in BC".  But this is what makes Vancouver such a unique place to live.  Here, we live well, and all else can go to hell.
	
	So the [artsy fartsy] turd from Toronto complaining about the prints in our pseudo art-galleries, can suck his broadway-loving metrosexual partner back in Central Canada - while Hollywood continues to film their movies on our West Coast- and thank his mayor for giving us the 2010 Games; and the rednecks belittling [Vancouver's] lack of head offices will hopefully enjoy the fumes from their neighbourhood Stelco plant.
		Example: [Vancouver] is the only place in [Canada] with a real chance of becoming a world [city].

	(2006-12-02 +196/-82)
	The land of great beauty with high standards of living, flowing with milk and honey, run abound by Asians, natives, mixed people whose race you can never guess, and sexy blond girls accompanied by their hot moms.  The land of fresh seafood, fine dining, and the [province's] most lucrative agricultural produce - high-quality [BC bud] - God's gift to mankind. A place where cops can pass by a group of Hondurians dealing cocaine on the corner of [Dunsmuir] and Seymour...and neither group does a [doubletake].  The streetscape is filled with beamers, race cars and souped up civics...it's a place where you can sit back with your stash of weed and appreciate for eternity the beauty of living in the best place on earth.
		Example: [Vancouver] is in [BC], where God [lives].

	(2008-04-26 +49/-22)
	A beautiful city on the west coast. One of the few places in Canada with potential to be a world city. The climate is moderate and it never gets cold, however it rains alot and heavy [overcast] is highly common. The best drugs in Canada are available here thus meaning, the best drugs in the world. Vancouver is a real relaxed, open minded, multi cultural, [hippie town]. The people are friendly, and there is endless things to do. Plus the scenery is gorgeous. However there is a downside. The [lower eastside] ([east hastings] and main) is the poorest neighbourhood in Canada. The highest concentration of HIV/AIDS in the western world, and alot of people have hepatitas. However if you don't have unprotected sex with the hookers and don't share needles you should be fine. The drug epidemic does take away from the city (slightly) however you don't see as many junkies shooting up in the streets due to the 'safe shoot up center'. 
		Example: K: I love [Vancouver].
		A: I hate that [rainy], hippie infested, [shit pit]!
		K: Your loss.

	(2006-09-24 +170/-118)
	A place that [San Francisco], a city [three times] its size, tries to [copy].
		Example: Many cites now look to the concept of "Vancouverism" as a model of [sustainability] and eco-density to fix the problems facing the typical American [urban sprawl].  Alas, Toronto is too busy hating the West Coast and [fluffing] it's feathers as the capital of Canada to notice.

	(2007-08-14 +64/-42)
	A beautiful city on the west coast of Canada about 40% the size of Toronto, but offering much more by way of quality.
	
	Pros include hottest women and cars, best beaches, cleanest air, best weather in Canada, nicest architecture, densest skyline, highest [population density], most boats per capita, always no 1,2, or 3 in the world for quality of life.
	
	Cons include the worst congestion, worst drug problem, poorest ghetto, the least affordable real estate in the country (families live in condos because houses are for millionaries only), and outside of May-October it rains a hell of a lot.
	
	Except for [Torontonians], whom from personal experience have nothing good to say bout the city (never expected rivalry among Canadians), just about anyone who has ever visited the place return with praises for the scenery, [street life], etc.
		Example: Their city has become a verb...I study [ecology] in UCLA and they've got us reading up on "Vancouverism", so I go wtf.  But [I've been there] before and their skyline is tremendous... puts [LA's] downtown to shame even without tall buildings!

	(2006-04-08 +175/-130)
	A city on the west coast with godly scenery that enjoys [California weather], to which sad bitter obese easterners living in a grey architectureless mess of a wet fart called Toronto hope to some day move to, that is if they can fork out the three-quarters million pricetag for a lower-middle class three bedroom rowhouse two hours away from downtown in [leafty] suburbs that aren't really suburbs since the lots are about 20 feet wide due to [smart city] planning.
		Example: Fat White boy from Toronto: Yeah I live in [Rosedale] man.
		Asian from Vancouver: Eight city blocks of old money trash
		Fat White boy from Toronto: FOB with no working credentials.
		Asian from Vancouver: Let's go, my [SLR] vs [ur mother's] cadillac

		Person 2: What's Rosedale?
		Person 1: It's 8 city blocks of very expensive houses in Toronto.  Mine cost [one Million]!!!
		Person 2: Eww Toronto. We have a Rosedale too.  It's called [Vancouver].  Only difference is that we have trees to look at.

vancouver island
	(2008-05-24 +78/-13)
	gods gift of beautiful scenery on the west coast, home to hippies on the small islands of denmanand [hornby] and weed growers alike plus a large population of hicks on upper vancouver island around the [comox valley] and surrounding areas. Being on the west coast yields more rain on vancouver island than the rainforest during a [monsoon season] and the combination of that rain and the limestone landscape makes vancouver island a rich [karst] region with an estimated 2000 or so caves to be discovered. The island is also a place to find some amazing scuba diving and artifical reefs such as 2 sunken battleships near the city of nanaimo. The island boast a rich variety of beaches, rivers, lakes, mountains and skiing, campsites, fishing, and plenty of protected parks making it a beautiful place to call home.
		Example: "when i die i hope [i go] to [heaven]"
		"well its only a short [ferry] ride to vancouver island....."

	(2009-03-15 +44/-19)
	a really beautiful [place]. [you should] [go there].

Vancouver Washington
	(2012-04-01 +484/-93)
	A waste of space. One of the most horrible places to live. A place where there are several sex offenders and drug addicts, but living in Vancouver is obviously a punishment in and of itself. Nosy Neighbors, a bunch of worthless pieces of white trash, crackers, meth addicts, alcoholics. This place can drive a normal person nuts and into suicide into a blink of an eye. Tacoma, Washington joins this list. Just rain, growing apples, and fishing are forms of entertainment.
	
	Shit schools [Hough] elementary, white trash areas to point out, [Fruit Valley], Orchards, [Camas], Hazel Dell. You could [piss and shit] on Vancouver and you would not notice it. One of the highest unemployment rates across the country, no job potential. An economy that will never recover in Vancouver, its like a slowing tooth decay.
		Example: Where can I find a place to be bored that would put me [in a state] of being [suicidal]?
		
		Example Oh thats [easy] go to Vancouver Washington.

	(2020-03-09 +150/-0)
	A church inside a former Kmart.
	
	That's the summation of this place based on an actual establishment. I get the sense the [hoakey] small town center like any old [thyme] town center has been abandoned to tiny gift shops while the suburbs were built up around it. Life there is a purgatory for grown up suburban kids where they drive from their apartment block to a gas station, to a office block, to Applebees, and back again. They watch Netflix and wait to die, [keeling] over from a broken heart 2 weeks after retirement realizing what I just said.
		Example: "You're [47] years old. It's finally time you get your own [apartment]."
		
		"Ok mom, I'll [move to] Vancouver, Washington. Can I borrow the car?"

	(2012-03-29 +508/-42)
	A depressing place, not enough words to describe of how much of a cesspool and shit-hole is. Iv never lived in Tacoma, Washington or other depressing places like Vancouver, Washington.
	
	Im sure there are more depressing places out there, but Vancouver from personal experience takes the cake. No jobs, an abundance of illiterate pieces of white trash, food stamp abusers, ignorant people who seem they have spent their whole life living in a cave. A bunch of wanksters and wiggers, [spoonfed] bitches who post pics on facebook, myspace, and other bullshit social networks drinking a can of beer proclaiming they are hood and hard.
	
	King of meth addicts and copious amounts of drug abusers, bad weather, a surplus of rain almost 90 percent of the year or more, [no entertainment]. Downtown Vancouver is dead like a grave, just a bus stop and some drug junkies, [pan handlers] and some stupid cafes with the greyhound bus station.
		Example: Where can I find a place that has [no hope] or [promise] and I am [100 percent] depressed? That is easy that is
		
		Vancouver, Washington

	(2013-01-21 +179/-33)
	The downtown is okay now, thanks to a few young people building some cool stores and restauraunts, but the rest of [Vancouver] pretty much sucks. There are two types of people in Vancouver:
	
	1) Smart people. These people wish they lived in [Portland], but don't for one of three reasons: no [income tax], gay marriage, or because they have kids and Portland Public Schools are crap. These people want [light rail] so they can get to Portland faster and away from people-type #2.
	
	2) Fools. These people think Vancouver is part of Texas. They tend to love Wal-Mart and driving their cars everywhere. They refuse to recognize the fact that Portland is cool or really even that [it exists]. They hate change and don't want light rail.
	
	People-type #1 tend to live in southwest Vancouver to be closer to Portland, though can be found periodically elsewhere. People-type #2 exist more commonly in northern Clark County, but you can find them spread throughout suburbia or occassionally attending rallies protesting things they don't understand.
		Example: I want [light rail] so I can get out of Vancouver, Washington and into [Portland] [faster].

	(2011-10-24 +580/-150)
	One of the most depressing spots in the world. It is stated as the 4th largest city in the state of Washington, when in reality it is just an extremely large suburb of Portland Oregon. Vancouver is primarily a residential area, with everyone typically commuting to portland for work (Hence the term "suburb"). The most common nick names for Vancouver are "[The Couve]" and "[Vantucky]", the ladder of which refers to the staggering amount of white trash that call Vancouver Home.
	
	Anyone who says they love Vancouver has either never been outside the city limits or is referring to [Vancouver's] big sister up in Canada. In fact in a recent survey, 9 out of 10 people said they would actually up and leave town if they had the means. The other 10% began sobbing and shaking uncontrollably, knowing that it would never happen.
	
	If you looked at young woman who had just recently moved to Vancouver, and [checked up] on her 10 years later, you would find that she would be living in a decrepit 50s style [ranch house] with an abusive husband, 6 children, a diseased Pitbull and an addiction to some sort of illicit drug.
	Vancouver changes you.
	
	Many experts have tried deducing why Vancouver is such an overwhelmingly boring and depressing place. Some point to the weather. Others blame the lack of entertainment in Vancouver.
	
	In short, [Vancouver Washington] may well be one of the worst places on earth.
		Example: "Hey have you been here before?"
		
		"Where?"
		
		"This place. [Vancouver Washington]."
		
		"Nope, my buddy said it was a total [hell hole] though."
		
		"[Oh ok]."

	(2006-06-10 +559/-182)
	A god forsaken town located in the [PNW] on [the Columbia] River. It is often referred to as "[the couve]" by locals. Located right at the border of Washington and Oregon, it is often confused with it's sister city [Vancouver] Cananda. Vancouver is named after Captain Vancouver duh who came down the Columbia River and built Fort Vancouver. Vancouver is a growing city, Clark County where it is located is the fastest growing county in Washington.
	
	Vancouver is half trash/half suburbs. [East Vancouver] is full of suburbs and housing developments. Alot of scene kids, and goth kids live here. [West Vancouver] is full of trashy houses and alot of meth heads. 
	
	Not everything about Vancouver is bad, it is located right across the river from Portland, Oregon. And there is always the river which is nice to look at.
	
	It is too bad that nearly all kids/teenagers hate Vancouver with a passion and the most common phrase heard is "Are you going to Portland?" Or "I fucking hate Vancouver" Most teenagers dream to escape to Portland or perhaps Seattle. For the most part, only older people like Vancouver, and they suffer to make their children live in this city.
	
	Tragedy strikes Vancouver often it seems, as two teenagers were murdered this year, and it seems as though there are more shootings/baby killing not abortions and roberys every day. 
	
	One is lucky to escape Vancouver. 
		Example: Scene kids:
		[scene kid] #1:"hey man, are you going to the new bleeding xxx my heart show in [Portland]"
		scene kid #2:"No man, my mom fucking grounded me, all I did was borrow her eyeliner"
		
		everyone else:
		kid #1:"I'm bored, there's nothing to do"
		kid #2:"I know, I fucking hate [Vancouver Washington], I can't wait to move"

	Im sure there are more depressing places out there, but Vancouver from personal experience takes the cake. No jobs, an abundance of illiterate pieces of white trash, food stamp abusers, ignorant people who seem they have spent their whole life living in a cave. A bunch of wanksters and wiggers, [spoonfed] bitches who post pics on facebook, myspace, and other bullshit social networks drinking a can of beer proclaiming they are hood and hard.
	
	King of meth addicts and copious amounts of drug abusers, bad weather, a surplus of rain almost 90 percent of the year or more, [no entertainment]. Downtown Vancouver is dead like a grave, just a bus stop and some drug junkies, [pan handlers] and some stupid cafes with the greyhound bus station.
		Example: Where can I find a place that has [no hope] or [promise] and I am [100 percent] depressed? That is easy that is
		
		Vancouver, Washington

	(2013-01-21 +179/-33)
	The downtown is okay now, thanks to a few young people building some cool stores and restauraunts, but the rest of [Vancouver] pretty much sucks. There are two types of people in Vancouver:
	
	1) Smart people. These people wish they lived in [Portland], but don't for one of three reasons: no [income tax], gay marriage, or because they have kids and Portland Public Schools are crap. These people want [light rail] so they can get to Portland faster and away from people-type #2.
	
	2) Fools. These people think Vancouver is part of Texas. They tend to love Wal-Mart and driving their cars everywhere. They refuse to recognize the fact that Portland is cool or really even that [it exists]. They hate change and don't want light rail.
	
	People-type #1 tend to live in southwest Vancouver to be closer to Portland, though can be found periodically elsewhere. People-type #2 exist more commonly in northern Clark County, but you can find them spread throughout suburbia or occassionally attending rallies protesting things they don't understand.
		Example: I want [light rail] so I can get out of Vancouver, Washington and into [Portland] [faster].

	(2012-04-01 +484/-93)
	A waste of space. One of the most horrible places to live. A place where there are several sex offenders and drug addicts, but living in Vancouver is obviously a punishment in and of itself. Nosy Neighbors, a bunch of worthless pieces of white trash, crackers, meth addicts, alcoholics. This place can drive a normal person nuts and into suicide into a blink of an eye. Tacoma, Washington joins this list. Just rain, growing apples, and fishing are forms of entertainment.
	
	Shit schools [Hough] elementary, white trash areas to point out, [Fruit Valley], Orchards, [Camas], Hazel Dell. You could [piss and shit] on Vancouver and you would not notice it. One of the highest unemployment rates across the country, no job potential. An economy that will never recover in Vancouver, its like a slowing tooth decay.
		Example: Where can I find a place to be bored that would put me [in a state] of being [suicidal]?
		
		Example Oh thats [easy] go to Vancouver Washington.

	(2011-10-24 +580/-150)
	One of the most depressing spots in the world. It is stated as the 4th largest city in the state of Washington, when in reality it is just an extremely large suburb of Portland Oregon. Vancouver is primarily a residential area, with everyone typically commuting to portland for work (Hence the term "suburb"). The most common nick names for Vancouver are "[The Couve]" and "[Vantucky]", the ladder of which refers to the staggering amount of white trash that call Vancouver Home.
	
	Anyone who says they love Vancouver has either never been outside the city limits or is referring to [Vancouver's] big sister up in Canada. In fact in a recent survey, 9 out of 10 people said they would actually up and leave town if they had the means. The other 10% began sobbing and shaking uncontrollably, knowing that it would never happen.
	
	If you looked at young woman who had just recently moved to Vancouver, and [checked up] on her 10 years later, you would find that she would be living in a decrepit 50s style [ranch house] with an abusive husband, 6 children, a diseased Pitbull and an addiction to some sort of illicit drug.
	Vancouver changes you.
	
	Many experts have tried deducing why Vancouver is such an overwhelmingly boring and depressing place. Some point to the weather. Others blame the lack of entertainment in Vancouver.
	
	In short, [Vancouver Washington] may well be one of the worst places on earth.
		Example: "Hey have you been here before?"
		
		"Where?"
		
		"This place. [Vancouver Washington]."
		
		"Nope, my buddy said it was a total [hell hole] though."
		
		"[Oh ok]."

	(2006-06-10 +559/-182)
	A god forsaken town located in the [PNW] on [the Columbia] River. It is often referred to as "[the couve]" by locals. Located right at the border of Washington and Oregon, it is often confused with it's sister city [Vancouver] Cananda. Vancouver is named after Captain Vancouver duh who came down the Columbia River and built Fort Vancouver. Vancouver is a growing city, Clark County where it is located is the fastest growing county in Washington.
	
	Vancouver is half trash/half suburbs. [East Vancouver] is full of suburbs and housing developments. Alot of scene kids, and goth kids live here. [West Vancouver] is full of trashy houses and alot of meth heads. 
	
	Not everything about Vancouver is bad, it is located right across the river from Portland, Oregon. And there is always the river which is nice to look at.
	
	It is too bad that nearly all kids/teenagers hate Vancouver with a passion and the most common phrase heard is "Are you going to Portland?" Or "I fucking hate Vancouver" Most teenagers dream to escape to Portland or perhaps Seattle. For the most part, only older people like Vancouver, and they suffer to make their children live in this city.
	
	Tragedy strikes Vancouver often it seems, as two teenagers were murdered this year, and it seems as though there are more shootings/baby killing not abortions and roberys every day. 
	
	One is lucky to escape Vancouver. 
		Example: Scene kids:
		[scene kid] #1:"hey man, are you going to the new bleeding xxx my heart show in [Portland]"
		scene kid #2:"No man, my mom fucking grounded me, all I did was borrow her eyeliner"
		
		everyone else:
		kid #1:"I'm bored, there's nothing to do"
		kid #2:"I know, I fucking hate [Vancouver Washington], I can't wait to move"

vanessa carlton
	(2005-11-05 +358/-60)
	Possibly the most underrated artist ever... after her [big hit] "A Thousand Miles" people thought her an [untalented] [teenybopper], but shes actually very talented... Just listen to her new album, Harmonium.  I really hope she comes back into the spotlight, she deserves it.
		Example: ME: Wow, I love [Vanessa Carlton's] new CD!
		[UNEDUCATED] PERSON: [Vanessa] who?

	(2005-10-16 +102/-154)
	An awesome [pianist] who writes and composes her own music, and is a "real" artist, but [truthfully], she should really just be part of an [emo rock] band, because her lyrics are jsut oh-so depressing and will make someone want to kill this girl for making them feel so down.
		Example: "There's nothing you can do, someone gently says to you "the doctor says that now it won't be long", i try and live up to the moment, hope that i dont [blow it], what is it in me that she hears? Its just the song she likes, her [little arms] around my neck, and a dying girl whispers in my ears..."- [Vanessa carlton], Annie

	(2006-11-17 +43/-232)
	An annoying-ass singing girl who is [borderline emo]. Her song, "A Thousand Miles", is the epitome of [cliched] pussy lyrics. Her songs make any heterosexual male cringe, and any girl who isn't Paris Hilton or a fan of Green Day want to DIE. As for being underrated, I will admit that she does have instrumental talent... too bad she [botches] it with these seriously annoyingly whiny songs. Some artists actually ARE underrated for a reason. Carlton falls into this category. 
		Example: Remember that movie "[White Chicks]"? The fact that those rich, pathetic, mentally-5-years-old bitches are obsessed with this [Vanessa Carlton] song proves my above points. She totally doesn't deserve more fame and more time on the radio whining out her depressing songs that make every self-respecting [music lover] want to cut themselves.

	(2007-08-06 +256/-43)
	A very underrated artist who can actually sing. Unlike many other singers these days, [Vanessa's] lyrics aren't pointless or sex-caked. Her second album, Harmonium was a [commercial failure], which led to her department of [A&M] records. Her third  album, Heroes and Thieves is supposed to come out in October 2007.
		Example: Vanessa Carlton [sells] her feelings while other [artists] [these days] sell their body...

	Recently, nude pictures of her were leaked on the internet.

	Please search up shave if you have any questions.
		Example: Vanessa Hudgens is [hella] hot!
		[-sees] [nude] picture-
		...

	(2008-06-02 +485/-315)
	A Filipino actress who just can't seem to grow out of childrens movies due to the marketing ploy called the "High School Musical" trilogy. Despite that she's had nude photos taken of her across the internet, there really is nothing or hers worth staring at. With no particular beauty, no particular talent, and a bitchy personality, the only thing that's keeping her a celebrity is (1) [tenure] from Disney, (2) her pussy, Zac Efron and her best friend, [Ashley Tisdale], and (3) the media being forced to keep their eyes on her. One Disney alumni who practically is the opposite of Vanessa Hudgens is [Hayden Panettiere], who actually has dedicated her life to making the world better for everyone.
		Example: Girl: Oh my god! Vanessa Hudgens is in here! Let's go meet her [right away]!
		Boy: Hey, isn't that one of those "cool" kids from our school? Sure looks like it.
		Girl: What?! But she's...uh...she's got [a ton] of money. Yeah!
		Boy: Like the kind she finds in her underwear at clubs?
		Girl: I guess [your right], perhaps I can find girls hotter AND more friendly than her. It's possible.

	(2007-12-02 +1072/-812)
	A dirty, no good [fucking slut], who needs to [pose] naked to get [peer pressure] out of her life.  
		Example: [Ass of] [a slut] + A bitch with [no life]= Vanessa Hudgens

	(2010-02-11 +173/-146)
	A talented actress who people only hate because she took nude photos of herself and is dating Zac Efron, which a lot of people admit that's why they hate her. If you overlook the horrible cheese fest that is High School Musical you will be able to see how talented she is in [Bandslam], which she garnered a lot of praise for when she was in the movie for at least less than fifteen minutes. She stars in the upcoming movie Beastly, out on [July 30], 2010, and [SuckerPunch], out in 2011.
		Example: Uninformed person: Wow, Vanessa Hudgens is such a [famewhore]! She totally released those pictures the day of her [premiere] so she could get more attention!
		
		Informed person: You do realize that the person who leaked the nude pictures in 2007 had another set and just leaked them today, right?
		
		Uninformed person: [Liar, liar, pants on fire]!

	(2007-09-17 +571/-568)
	A sexy and hot actress who stars in The [Disney Channel's] "[High School Musical]" series. Also has been caught up in a [scandal] more recently regarding nude pictures that were taken of her.

	(2008-03-30 +580/-448)

	An [ugly chick] with a man [chin] who stars on the [Disney Channel]. 
		Example: That girl was such a [Vanessa Hudgens]! Her [chin] was so [manly]! 

	(2008-01-13 +196/-200)
	An American actress who was known for her [good girl] Disney image before naked photos of her "accidentally" leaked out *coughpublicitystuntcough*. She was then upstaged by Jaimee-Lynn Spears (16) who got pregnant by her 19-year old boyfriend who is now demanding a [paternity test]. I give Vanessa points for originality since most actresses who had a childlike, good girl image posed for Playboy in order to get a sexier look. She has dated both guys ([Drake Bell]) and girls (Zac Efron) and her songs are catchy.
		Example: Guy: Hey! Remember that internet [scandal] involving naked photos of [Vanessa Hudgens]?
		Girl: What? Sorry, I'm reading this article on Jaimee-Lynn Spears' [pregnancy].

She is only famous because of her relationship with Johnny Depp. She is a fugly woman with mad pubes, a flat chest, and a tiny and shapeless body.

She is [soooooooooooooo] lucky to be with Johnny Depp (who is the SEXIEST, HOTTEST, wittiest, funniest, most talented, generous, and charming man EVER)!!!

		Lamar: "No, but acting like other people are fucked up for wanting more and suppressing your disgust every time someone brings up sex that's not your bland nothingness-- like they're degenerates for not wanting to have bland vanilla sex like you-- is insufferable, and your [relationship's] gonna end because you're not willing to budge on this."

vaporator
	(2006-01-17 +423/-104)
	The most efficient way to smoke weed. Fully releases all of the THC from the weed, saving your lungs from the abuse of [J's], [spliffs], and blunts. You will exhale a white, ODORLESS vapor, making [toking up] at home and in a standard college dorm room much less risky. Gets you more high off less weed, pays for itself.
		Example: We're gonna [come back] from [the party] and hit the vaporizer and [get RIPPED].

	(2003-10-07 +527/-141)
	A device used to [heat up] marijuana buds (around 390-something degrees F) to the point where the material (including the THC, [Cbd]/[cbn], etc.) is  a [vapor] form.  Usually, the vapor is held in longer than smoke, somewhere between 15-30 seconds.  Also, the vapor is drawn slower than smoke is inhaled, for about the same time as it is held in the lungs.  
	
	There are various types of vaporizers, the most efficient being the heat [convection] types, which pass heat through the material rather than heat it up.  Dome vaporizers, which usually consist of a brass bowl and a plastic or glass dome, and a [suction] tube, are considered by different studies to be less efficient and possibly harmful.  Unfortunately, the most efficient vaporizers tend to be the most expensive.
		Example: [Save] your money for a vapie, your [lungs] [beg] you.  

	(2006-04-18 +541/-152)
	Situation where someone treats someone one way, usually negatively, and then at a later point in time regrets what was done to that other person in the past or begins to treat the same person in a more respectful manner.  Identified in the [1988] [Biz Markie] song "[Vapors]." 
		Example: Girls [dissed] you because you were broke.  Now that you blew-up and have money, the same girls want to [get with you].  These women have caught [the vapors].  
		
		Guy breaks up with his girlfriend.  Later on realizes that she was all he ever wanted and that breaking up with her was a mistake.  Now he wants her back.  He's got the vapors.

	(2011-11-20 +12/-1)
	The act of inhaling and exhaling from an [electronic cigarette]. A better definition of vaporing through an electronic cigarette rather than "smoking". It would not make any sense if someone said they were smoking an electronic cigarette as they [generate] water [vapor].
		Example: I was vaporing outside the bar to avoid annoying the hell out of the drunkards and bouncers with [the fog] getting in their way.
		
		"John: I feel like meh. I don't feel like smoking either. Especially when I quit. I would smoke if it didn't have the harmful substances.
		
		Tom:Really? I'll be vaporing my [e-cig] and you can sit here contemplating the usual.
		
		John:Hey! Can I try it? Finally something better than those [cancer sticks]!"

	(2004-04-21 +244/-81)

	(2009-05-16 +145/-50)

Typically a matter of sexual or cultural taboo is being violated, such as the mention of a sexual or excretory organ in conversation.
		Example: 1. When Larry Summers claimed that men may have a greater innate ability in math than women, MIT biologist Nancy Hopkins had [the vapors]. In her own words she later explained "if I hadn't left, I would've either blacked out or thrown up."
		
		2. The reaction of characters played by Margaret [Dumont] in the films of the [Marx Brothers] to something shocking.

	(2012-01-09 +57/-19)
	The most efficient way of consuming substances found in herbs by avoiding [combustion] and the various health risks that are accustomed to smoke. Cannabis vaporized is proven to deliver most of the active ingredients found in the plant ([cannabinoids], flavinoids, etc) while avoiding the majority of tar, carcinogens and unwanted chemicals. The vaporizer does this by heating the herbal blend up with heat by using hot air ([convection]), a safe metal heating plate ([conduction]), or sometimes both. The extracted cannabinoids turn into a mist (or vapor), and is less irritating to the lungs, therefore reducing coughing and allowing you to inhale larger hits. Since THC can be destroyed by combustion, the total % of THC inhaled per hit is much more than smoking, therefore reducing the amount of herb used for desired effect; in the long run saving you money. By using heat right under the threshold of combustion, many chemicals found in smoke is not present in vapor. The temperatures used are from [314].6 F - 400+ F. When a vaporizer is first used, it tends to become the preferred method consumption, producing a positive, very cerebral [head high]. Many of the couch lock effects from smoking will be left behind, leaving you to want to get up and do something like socialize or get tasks done, instead of being a lazy couch potato. The biggest change people notice from making the switch to vaping is a HUGE reduction in phelgm, and the dreaded [Smokers Cough] goes away.
		Example: Your Lungs: Please help... All those joints, pipes and bongs rips are really starting to [take a toll] on my breathing functions. The [carbon monoxide], [tar] and cancer causing chemicals are rapidly destroying me! Whether or not [cannabinoids] help reduce risks of cancer, they don't help prevent many other respiratory diseases that likely WILL eventually develop if something is not changed.
		Your Brain: My lungs are right.. they have taken enough abuse, I think its time to switch to something safer and proven to prevent those diseases, im speaking of course, of vaporization. Time to save my money and my body from these terrible unwanted chemicals by using a vaporizer.
		Your Lungs: Thank you! I will forever be grateful and show my appreciation by staying disease and phlegm free for the rest of your long, happy, green-indulging life.

	(2010-09-25 +96/-40)
	Taking a [newfangled] and [opportunistic] liking to someone only after that person became successful. The subject of [Biz Markie's] song, "Vapors."
		Example: She wouldn't even [talk to me] in high school, and now she's sitting on my lap in my [Cadillac]. She caught [the vapors].

	(2006-03-16 +197/-107)

vaporette
	(2009-01-17 +76/-7)
	This is a device for turning liquids into smoke-like vapour. The liquid can contain nicotine and is usually called [e-liquid].
	
	Also known as an electronic cigarette, [e-cig], personal vapourising device.
	
	It is a [battery powered] device that emits a flavored fog containing nicotine (if the user prefers it) when inhaled. It is an alternative to real cigarettes, and contains no tobacco, tar, or the thousands of chemicals in tobacco smoke. It also produces no [second hand smoke] which makes it legal to smoke in most establishments.
	
	The device uses a liquid to produce the fog. The liquid consists of pharmaceutical grade Propylene Glycol, flavorings, and nicotine. Nicotine amounts are typically available in ranges of 0-36mg per ml. A small amount of users will experience an allergic reaction to PG and should discontinue use if symptoms appear. Care should be taken to keep the liquid out of reach of children and/or pets as nicotine is a poison.
	
	The [E-cig] comes in various models and colors, most of which are similar to the size of actual cigarettes and cigars.
	
	Although the words [E-Cig] and E-Cigarette are commonly used, they are not the best terms to describe the device.
		Example: [I don't] need [tobacco] when I can [vape] with my vaporette.

Vaporeon
	(2021-09-14 +118/-8)
	[cute cat]/fish [pokemon] that has been [ruined] by society
		Example: [134]# Vaporeon

	(2003-10-12 +123/-28)
	Vaporeon is a fox/fish Pokemon. It's good against fire, ground, and rock types. But is bad against [electric], grass, and dragon types. Vaporeon can melt itself in water and make itself [disappear]. Most people think it's [a mermaid] because of its long, beautiful tail.
		Example: To change [eevee] into this Pokemon, you must train eevee [wisley] and evolve it with a [water stone]. 

	(2021-12-06 +35/-7)
	A [Water-type] [Eeveelution] introduced in the first generation of Pokemon. It has been ruined by horny zoophiles and 4chan users.
	
	Do not make NSFW art of Vaporeon! If you do, I'll run over your fridge with an [Iveco] Daily!
		Example: Bob: *[faps] to a Vaporeon sprite*
		[Geoff]: [Time to die]!

	(2020-09-16 +238/-81)
	Vaporeon is the most fuckable [Pok√©mon].
	
	In terms of male human and female Pok√©mon breeding, Vaporeon is the most compatible Pok√©mon for humans? Not only are they in the field egg group, which is mostly comprised of mammals, Vaporeon are an average of 3"03' tall and [63].9 pounds. this means they're large enough to be able to handle human dicks, and with their impressive Base stats for HP and access to Acid Armor, you can be rough with one. Due to their mostly water based biology, there's no doubt in my mind that an aroused Vaporeon would be incredibly wet, so wet that you could easily have sex with one for hours without getting sore. They can also learn the moves Attract, Baby-Doll eyes, [Captivate], Charm and [Tail Whip] along with not having fur to hide nipples, so it'd be incredibly easy for one to get you in the mood. With their abilities Water Absorb and [Hydration], they can easily recover from fatigue with enough water. No other Pok√©mon comes close with this level of [compatibility]. Also, fun fact, if you pull out enough, you can make your Vaporeon turn white. Vaporeon is literally built for human dick. Ungodly defense stat + high HP pool + Acid Armor means it can take [cock all] day, all shapes and sizes and still come for more.
		Example: [Oh my God] [look at that] [moist] Vaporeon

	(2003-07-08 +21/-58)
	A [Water-] type Pokemon that evolves from Eevee when the [Water Stone] is used. It bears a passing resemblance to [Pietro Maximoff] a.k.a Quicksilver of X-men Evolution due to its ears :P
		Example: Quick- Oh, look at me..I have a [firm butt]...[lalalala] *trips over a Vaporeon* Hey, what's this thing doing here?
		Vaporeon- *Crawls on Quick and starts messing with his hair, then starts humping his leg*
		Quick- Not now, I have to show everyone my tight little butt. Get off me!
		*kicks Vaporeon, who gets [Po'ed] and does Blizzard on him*

	(2012-01-09 +57/-19)
	The most efficient way of consuming substances found in herbs by avoiding [combustion] and the various health risks that are accustomed to smoke. Cannabis vaporized is proven to deliver most of the active ingredients found in the plant ([cannabinoids], flavinoids, etc) while avoiding the majority of tar, carcinogens and unwanted chemicals. The vaporizer does this by heating the herbal blend up with heat by using hot air ([convection]), a safe metal heating plate ([conduction]), or sometimes both. The extracted cannabinoids turn into a mist (or vapor), and is less irritating to the lungs, therefore reducing coughing and allowing you to inhale larger hits. Since THC can be destroyed by combustion, the total % of THC inhaled per hit is much more than smoking, therefore reducing the amount of herb used for desired effect; in the long run saving you money. By using heat right under the threshold of combustion, many chemicals found in smoke is not present in vapor. The temperatures used are from [314].6 F - 400+ F. When a vaporizer is first used, it tends to become the preferred method consumption, producing a positive, very cerebral [head high]. Many of the couch lock effects from smoking will be left behind, leaving you to want to get up and do something like socialize or get tasks done, instead of being a lazy couch potato. The biggest change people notice from making the switch to vaping is a HUGE reduction in phelgm, and the dreaded [Smokers Cough] goes away.
		Example: Your Lungs: Please help... All those joints, pipes and bongs rips are really starting to [take a toll] on my breathing functions. The [carbon monoxide], [tar] and cancer causing chemicals are rapidly destroying me! Whether or not [cannabinoids] help reduce risks of cancer, they don't help prevent many other respiratory diseases that likely WILL eventually develop if something is not changed.
		Your Brain: My lungs are right.. they have taken enough abuse, I think its time to switch to something safer and proven to prevent those diseases, im speaking of course, of vaporization. Time to save my money and my body from these terrible unwanted chemicals by using a vaporizer.
		Your Lungs: Thank you! I will forever be grateful and show my appreciation by staying disease and phlegm free for the rest of your long, happy, green-indulging life.

varg vikernes
	(2004-08-11 +236/-55)
	[Varg Vikernes] was born Kristian Vikernes on [February 11], 1973, outside of [Bergen], Norway. known by the [nom de plume] Count Grishnakh during the early days of black metal in Norway, Vikernes was the man behind the one-man music project [Burzum], and lately has become a prominent voice for [Neo-Nazism]. He is currently incarcerated for the 1993 murder of his former friend and member of the black metal-band Mayhem √òystein Aarseth (AKA [Euronymous]), serving a sentence of 21 years, the maximum possible in Norway. Euronymous published the first Burzum records, though the circumstances surrounding the reason for the murder are not entirely clear. Aarseth no longer had control of Vikernes' material, but Vikernes claims Aarseth had threatened to kill him and that his act was infact 'premeditated self-defense', which according to his own "Nordic" code of ethics was a perfectly viable reason. According to those who knew both, these claims are probably fictitious. 
	Vikernes is a proponent of the √Åsatr√∫ religion and believes it is a religion for all Germanic peoples. He helped create the Odalist movement & co-founded the 'All-Germanic Heathen Front' (although he is neither a member nor a leader). He is the author of several short works on his personal [weltanschauung], namely 'Vargsm√•l' (lit. 'the speech of Varg'), 'Irmins√ªl' & 'Germansk Mytologi og Verdensanskuelse'. Vikernes interprets the old lore in a [fascistic] way and belongs to the leading heads of modern esoteric fascism. 
	He terminated his musical project that he continued from prison in 2000 due to the 'negative notoriety' which he believed he continually received from it as well as believing he was constantly misunderstood and misinterpreted by an 'ignorant' "fan" base that saw contradictions in either his outlook or how things he has said correlated to his outlook which he assures were never [contradictive] but simply novel & pervasive. 
	Vikernes has written lyrics for several songs by the band [Darkthrone] ("[quintessence]," "as fittermice as satan's spys" etc) that make use of characteristics from old Germanic folklore. In these, "satan" is brought up in the context of an 'eye' which is a source of light (i.e. the Sun) with mentions of a 'spear,' a 'hall of battle.' All of which are masked references to the Germanic god [Odin] as he has been identified by the Christian Church. This was done with the double meaning that Vikernes does indeed consider Odin the "Adversary" of Judeo-Christianity as they could understand it. This has been mostly mistaken as 'proving' that Vikernes was at one time a "Satanist" and therefore someone who cannot adhere to one line of thinking, but infact the case is that he is an artist as well as an [ideologue]. Vikernes has stated many times that he is entirely opposed to Satanism as he considers it a reactionary form of Christianity.
		Example: This man contradicts himself more than [Tony Blair], whereas some of Vargs [motions] are inspirational some are complete and [utter crap]!

	(2005-08-28 +194/-127)
	Some Norwegian dude who just happens to be one of the best musical geniuses ever. His band, [Burzum], totally defines [black metal]. The later works of Burzum are [ambient], but the earlier stuff was black metal, usually with excellent use of keyboards. While his music may be great, I tend to disagree with his beliefs when it comes to politics.
		Example: [Varg Vikernes] is the frontman of a [black metal] band called [Burzum].

	(2010-01-20 +76/-62)
	A black metal musician most famous for his work in his one-man "Burzum" project, who also worked with fellow [Norwegian black metal] pioneers Mayhem as a bassist on their first album. While he admittedly makes great music, he's a complete douchebag.
	
	He is an outspoken racist, [white supremist] and anti-semite, and he was sent to jail for 15 or 16 years due to his burning down of churches, and murder of bandmate [Euronymous] (Oystein Aarseth), founder and leader of Mayhem.
	
	In addition, he previously announced that his 2010 album would be named "Den Hvite [Guden]," meaning "the white god." Naturally, some people assumed that this would have some connection to his racism. However, he backlashed, saying that the "racist western media" was assuming things about his album. This makes him a hypocrite, for obvious reasons.
	
	Also, he's a pussy because he eventually gave into the pressure and changed the name of the album to "Belus," which still means "the white god," but by proper name. Regardless, he collapsed under pressure and he can't come out and swallow his pride and admit that he did.
		Example: Damn, that [Varg Vikernes] makes some [great] songs! But man, he's an [asshole].

	(2008-09-24 +39/-58)
	A [totally awesome] [Black Metal] musician, But he killed Euranymous of [Mayhem] so he's a dick.

	Notable [Pagan] Odanist and member of the one-man [black metal] band [Burzum]. Hated by Mayhem fans and I-judge-people-only-on-their-appearance people everywhere.
		Example: "A [fanatic] is simply an [idealist] you disagree with, and an idealist is simply a fanatic you agree with. So the "idealists" rule the "Western" world, and the "fanatics" like me are persecuted. That is how it works, and You should always [keep that in mind] when You read about people like me. It's still their game. You should also keep this in mind when You don't hear about people like me at all."
		- Varg Vikernes

	(2004-04-05 +147/-139)
	Born Kristian Kvisling Larson Vikernes, Varg Vikernes was born in Norway, where he grew up in Bergen. He met [Euronymous] and with him started the Black Metal band Mayhem with the name [Count Grishnackh]. Varg Vikernes was at the forefront of the Black Metal Movement. He murdered Euronymous, and was sentenced to 21 years of prison for it. Burzum is the project of this lone man. From his prison cell, he wrote his book Vargsmal, an indepth analysis about everything from race, to heritage, to the world as a whole.
	
	Varg seeks to rid the world of the Jewish and Christian [anti-culture], reinstate the beauty, heritage, and purity of his homeland. He is a hero to his people.

	He terminated his musical project that he continued from prison in 2000 due to the 'negative notoriety' which he believed he continually received from it as well as believing he was constantly misunderstood and misinterpreted by an 'ignorant' "fan" base that saw contradictions in either his outlook or how things he has said correlated to his outlook which he assures were never [contradictive] but simply novel & pervasive. 
	Vikernes has written lyrics for several songs by the band [Darkthrone] ("[quintessence]," "as fittermice as satan's spys" etc) that make use of characteristics from old Germanic folklore. In these, "satan" is brought up in the context of an 'eye' which is a source of light (i.e. the Sun) with mentions of a 'spear,' a 'hall of battle.' All of which are masked references to the Germanic god [Odin] as he has been identified by the Christian Church. This was done with the double meaning that Vikernes does indeed consider Odin the "Adversary" of Judeo-Christianity as they could understand it. This has been mostly mistaken as 'proving' that Vikernes was at one time a "Satanist" and therefore someone who cannot adhere to one line of thinking, but infact the case is that he is an artist as well as an [ideologue]. Vikernes has stated many times that he is entirely opposed to Satanism as he considers it a reactionary form of Christianity.
		Example: This man contradicts himself more than [Tony Blair], whereas some of Vargs [motions] are inspirational some are complete and [utter crap]!

	(2008-01-04 +113/-48)
	Notable [Pagan] Odanist and member of the one-man [black metal] band [Burzum]. Hated by Mayhem fans and I-judge-people-only-on-their-appearance people everywhere.
		Example: "A [fanatic] is simply an [idealist] you disagree with, and an idealist is simply a fanatic you agree with. So the "idealists" rule the "Western" world, and the "fanatics" like me are persecuted. That is how it works, and You should always [keep that in mind] when You read about people like me. It's still their game. You should also keep this in mind when You don't hear about people like me at all."
		- Varg Vikernes

	(2005-08-28 +194/-127)
	Some Norwegian dude who just happens to be one of the best musical geniuses ever. His band, [Burzum], totally defines [black metal].

	(2010-01-20 +76/-62)
	A black metal musician most famous for his work in his one-man "Burzum" project, who also worked with fellow [Norwegian black metal] pioneers Mayhem as a bassist on their first album. While he admittedly makes great music, he's a complete douchebag.
	
	He is an outspoken racist, [white supremist] and anti-semite, and he was sent to jail for 15 or 16 years due to his burning down of churches, and murder of bandmate [Euronymous] (Oystein Aarseth), founder and leader of Mayhem.
	
	In addition, he previously announced that his 2010 album would be named "Den Hvite [Guden]," meaning "the white god." Naturally, some people assumed that this would have some connection to his racism. However, he backlashed, saying that the "racist western media" was assuming things about his album. This makes him a hypocrite, for obvious reasons.
	
	Also, he's a pussy because he eventually gave into the pressure and changed the name of the album to "Belus," which still means "the white god," but by proper name. Regardless, he collapsed under pressure and he can't come out and swallow his pride and admit that he did.
		Example: Damn, that [Varg Vikernes] makes some [great] songs! But man, he's an [asshole].

The ads were created as a parody of MTV's Pimp My Ride.
	The commercials began airing in late February 2006. Prior to the full launch of the TV campaign, the three 30-second spots became something of an internet phenomenon when popular automotive news website Leftlane News uploaded the ads to video distribution service YouTube. As of early March 2006, the ads had received over two million views on YouTube. Three years later, that number was over 10 million. The Term used for [Volkswagen's] cars "VDub" as a parody became so popular that fans and owners started to use it for their cars and VW's in general.

	[Veal] is a meat produced from [calves].
	
	There are three types of [veal]: "Bob" veal (calves slaughtered when only a few days old), formula-fed veal, and nonformula-fed veal or "red veal". Nonformula-fed veal calves are given grain, hay, or other solid food in addition to milk. Formula-fed (or "milk-fed") veal calves are raised in confinement on a solely [liquid diet]. The humane movement is most concerned with this group. The consumption of veal is an important part of the Italian and French diets, and the ancient part of these cultures. Due to the toughness of nonformula-fed veal, these groups are unlikely to see it as a substitute. Julia Child remarked in her The Way to Cook that nonformula-fed veal ought to be called calf.
	
	Formula-fed veal calves are traditionally raised by [restricting] their physical movement in order to minimize the growth of tough muscle fiber and to keep their flesh white and tender. The finest veal meat comes from unweaned calves. Formula-fed veal farming is universally condemned by animal rights activists and other sympathizers and is used as an example of the cruelty of modern large scale animal farming, more commonly referred to as [factory farming].
		Example: 
		[Veal] bones are used to make [veal] stock, a base for many sauces and [soups] found in French [cuisine], including demi-glace.

Being of prestigious nobility, the Vega house was also involved in some coup attempts to [claim the throne] and rule over much of Spain. Being staunch Christians and loyal to the Catholic Church, some of the Vega house traveled west to the New World and started the many families in North America that bear the name of Vega, however again, anyone living in North America who has the Vega last name from their parents is related to other Vegas, with a common ancestor probably living three or four hundred years ago, from the time of immigration. [The Vegas], also being of an old noble house, never had to pay taxes, and still don't even in Spain today. There are roughly 110,000 Vegas in the world. Also some gaming company that made SF 2 had a character in it named "Vega", and this is where most morons tend to associate the name "Vega" from. Some travelers on the way to California long ago passed through an oasis in Nevada, and they named it "Las Vegas", meaning "[The meadow](s)", because of it being an oasis in the desert.

	Veganism is a diet that obstains from any animal products (meat) or bi-products (i.e. eggs, milk, wool, leather, etc).  
	
	Most people will assume that because you follow a vegan lifestyle, you must be a [pretentious jerk] (or in a cult).  This is NOT always the case (although you do have your exceptions that give the rest of us a bad name).  
	
	Being vegan doesn't mean you have to be a part of any organization (i.e. PETA) or chain yourself up and protest.  It just means that you choose to follow a 100% [herbivore] diet for whatever reason.  Choosing to be vegan for diet purposes or [animal rights] purposes doesn't matter, as long as you're doing it because YOU want to. 
	
	If you do it correctly you DO NOT GET SICK and you DO NOT NEED SUPPLIMENTS in order to be healthy and happy.  :-.)  
		Example: *At a "mixed" bbq party*  (Who would have thought vegans dine with meat-eaters?  Yes, it's true, we do!  OMG!)

	A violation of nature. Humans, like other species, have evolved with the fortune of the ability to [digest] meat and vegetables, and this should be used.

But then again, maybe [the bears] are smarter.

Vegemite Cup
	(2009-09-30 +112/-71)
	A slang term rarely used in Australian Rules Football for premierships that were won before 1950, by supporters of clubs who were unsuccessful in the era of the grand old game‚Äôs early champions such as Dick Reynolds, Jack [Dyer] and Roy Cazaly. Supporters who use this term are trying to hide the unsuccessful and possibly queer beginnings ([Hawthorn] Mayblooms) of their own club, by [weakly] implying older premierships are less worthy because the sport hadn‚Äôt reached the massive business status of today‚Äôs age.
		Example: ‚ÄúWow [Essendon] have won 16 premierships!!"

Vegemite
	(2013-09-19 +64/-6)
	A spread for toast made of vegetable extract. While it is extremely popular in Australia, it is reviled everywhere else. This aspect of [vegemite] is used for great humour by we Australians, as a single smear of it will reduce a non-Australian to a quivering jelly, similar to a veteran of ['Nam].
	To make a [vegemite sandwich], you must toast two slices of bread, and then [butter it]. You must then add just the right amount of spread, I find that half-a-teaspoon per slice works perfectly. Press the two slices together, and eat. Then, depending on nationality, you will proceed to the local pub or to the ER.
	Some leading scientists theorise that we Australians can digest vegemite do to our stomachs and tongues being lined with a natural Kevlar, strengthened by years of swearing, drinking and licking kangaroos.
		Example: Robert: Hey, you wanna try a [Vegemite sandwich]?
		[Johann]: Okay, I've never had one before.
		Robert (prepares sandwich) here you go.
		(Johann eats it, then coughs up own [appendix])
		Robert: Wussy.

		And he said,
		
		"I come from a [land down under]
		Where beer does flow and men chunder
		Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?
		You better run, you better take cover!"
		

	(2003-07-29 +1122/-409)
	Delicious Australian spread, made from used [brewer's yeast].  Non-Australians tend to give descriptions of it similar to 'tastes like a mixture of salt and battery acid'.  This is because they are [wimps], and need to drink more beer, eat more [pies], and of course, eat more Vegemite.
		Example: We're happy little Vegemites, as bright as bright can be,
		We all enjoy our Vegemite for breakfast, lunch and tea,
		Our [mummies] say we're growing stronger every single week,
		Because we love our Vegemite,
		We all adore our Vegemite,

	(2005-08-17 +609/-261)
	Thick brown [brewer's yeast] paste from [the Land Down Under]. The slightest dollop on the end of a toothpick touched to [a slug's] back will incapacitate it in a matter of seconds, and render it a salty and torturous pool of black ooze in just under a minute effectively creating another couple ounces of Vegemite to dab on one's toast.
		Example: Pass the Vegemite, mate, [I ran] out of [nails] to [hammer] through my tongue.

	(2009-11-03 +119/-47)
	A dark, sticky food paste that has become a staple of the Australian diet. Made from [brewer's yeast], it is a rich source of B vitamins. [Brewer's yeast] is a by-product of the beer brewing process. Consequently, an ample supply exists in Australia. [Vegemite's] flavour is extremely salty and remarkably strong. It is one of the few things the alcohol-numbed tongues of inebriated Aussies can actually taste, hence its popularity in its home market. However, that popularity has not transitioned to other countries. In many English speaking cultures, it's known as "Satan's Stool" or "Poo in a Jar".
		Example: [Wizard of Oz]: "Oi, mate! Care for some Vegemite?"
		
		Sober Guy: "[No thanks]. I'd have to suck a [koala's] ass to get the taste out of my mouth."

	(2011-02-23 +147/-63)
	A [cancerous] deathpaste that tastes of [sadness], [batteries] and asses.

	[The prince of all saiyans]. He is [dragonball z's] second villain (along with nappa). He is named after his father and his home planet, formerly Planet Plant. It is when he first arrives on [namek] that he begins to change his evil ways, and later in the series, he would become one of the good guys. After witnessing Goku ([Kakarot])'s strength, he understands his potential to become a super saiyan, and obsesses over becoming one throughout the rest of the series.
	
	He falsely believes he is a super saiyan after coming back from near death some time after realizing that Goku is a super saiyan. He starts to become less evil after arriving on Earth after [Frieza's] defeat, but still retains his mean and arrogant attitude. He starts dedicating every hour of every day to training, pushing himself to hit limits and beyond, training at 450x normal gravity in order to become a super saiyan, and nearly killing himself in a training accident on earth. He goes to train in space as not to be bothered by Bulma or anyone else, and finally transforms on a planet where a meteor shower was going on.
	
	His name, like all Saiyans is a pun on vegetables, his name is a pun on the word vegetable.
		Example: Vegeta was able to transform into a [super saiyan] because of his motivation to be the best, and more importantly, better than Goku. His extreme frustration and NEEDING to experience becoming a super saiyan, he finally transforms after giving up his selfish ambition. For the brief period of time between Goku getting sick and transforming, he becomes stronger than him, but is surpassed during his training in other world where he learns to become a [super saiyan 3].

vegetarian
	(2003-05-08 +1921/-426)
	Someone who does not [eat meat]. This includes fish and [poultry], although some people claim to be 'modified vegetarians' and will eat these. Not to be confused with a vegan, who is someone who, in addition [to meat], avoids milk, eggs, and the like.
		Example: 'My vegetarian friend likes [chocolate milk], but my [vegan] friend will only drink [soymilk].'

	(2006-06-29 +15023/-5374)
	A bad [hunter].  Someone who survives by consuming [not food], but [the stuff] that food eats.
		Example: The vegetarian was forced to [subsist] on [slower] prey, such as the [broccoli] and carrot.

	(2004-05-20 +4077/-1507)
	Techinically a person who eats no meat or dead animal products. Some choose so for ethical reasons while others may simply be [grossed out] by the prospect of eating flesh. Despite claims to the contrary, most [vegetarians] are not elitist or prejudiced. Another false argument also includes that eating only plant matter kills more rodents, etc which it doesn't. In order to [eat beef] for instance, it takes far more energy and resources to grow food for them (as opposed to eating it directly) and then killing the cows [on top of it]. There've been many proposals for third world countries to focus on farming as opposed to [ranching] because, if done properly, it takes far less resources and land space. Another common argument is that it "destroys your body" which is blatantly false. It's actually very easy to get sufficient amounts of protein as well as other nutritional necesseties. While in the past it may have been necessary to eat animals to get by, many argue that it no longer is. Our canines are a "left over" so to speak of our evolution in the past.
	
	Despite all this, and despite that most vegetarians are non-judgmental and aren't affiliated with PETA in anyway, many get a good dose of humor out of bashing them. Presumably because the concept of not eating meat challenges their manhood and they need to defend their metaphorical [dick size].
		Example: I've been a vegetarian for years, since I was 16. The rest of my family has always eaten meat but I (like most others) don't hold it against them. But you can't convince the morons of that.
		
		*at dinner with a group of people*
		Person A: Yeah, I'll have a vegetarian burrito please.
		
		Person B: OH GOD. Oh what, are you a VEGETARIAN? Huh? You think you're too good for us?
		
		Person A: [Uhhh, no].
		
		Person B: Yeah, I can see it in your eyes! You're not gonna stop the rest of us I hope you know!
		
		Person A: You knowwww.... I really didn't plan on it. Eat what you want; [it's your choice].
		
		Person B: I told you you can't stop us! GOD, what is it with you people?! I'll bet you're a FASCIST too aren't ya? And a faggot. GOD, you [make me sick]. I bet you just can't STAND the thought of me eating a steak, can you? Huh? HUH?

	(2005-12-05 +386/-154)
	a vegetarian is one who, for various reasons, chooses that the eating of flesh is unnessasary for [survival]. recently, many people claim to be vegetarian, but still [eat fish], and/or chicken, and/or turkey. this is not a vegetarian. vegetarian is often confused with vegan. [veganism] is when someone does not eat any animal, or animal products(i.e. eggs, milk, cheese, etc) 
		Example: i have been a vegetarian since i was 16, and these are examples of conversations i have since i first became one:
		-um..can i get the taco, but without meat and beans instead please?
		--what, are you a vegetarian or something?
		-why yes, yes i am...
		--you arent going to like, start shouting PETA shit at me, or start crying when the next person gets something with meat in it are you?
		-no, why would i do that?
		--well, isnt that what you people do?
		-excuse me 'you people'?
		--yah, ya know, you vegetarian frea-i mean, people.
		-no, that's what we'd like to call a stereotype. for example if i said that you say 'would you like fries with that' all day, simply because you happen to work at a fast-food restaurant, that would be a stereotype.
		--dude, i think the lack of meat is making you bitchy...
		example 2:
		-do you eat [peanuts]?
		--what?
		--well, your sister said you're a vegetarian...so do you eat peanuts?
		-yah...why?
		--you aren't really a vegetarian then, real vegetarians dont eat any protein.
		-moron, we eat protein, it the eating of animals that i dont do. [Peanuts] happen to be [legumes].
		-do you eat [tofu] all the time?
		--i'm not particularly fond of tofu actually
		-then you really arent a vegetarian
		
		example 3:(this one came from my uncle, a hunter)
		-so you want steak for dinner tonight?
		--anctually, i'm a vegetarian
		-WHAT?! i bet you're in to all that [hippie shit] like poetry, and that queer art and all that wierd shit.
		--do you mean expression of self? creativity? beauty? if you do, then yes
		-my god, i never would've guessed my niece would become some [wierdo]...
		--thanks jim...
		-if you even THINK of dating some {[n-word]} i will shoot you and him both.
		--thats real civil of you. thanks for supporting me.
		(^note tone of sarcasm in statement immediately above this line)
		
		Ex4:
		MOM: huh..[applebees] doesnt have much in the way of [meatless] foods...
		me: i'll find something, i always do.
		MOM: you could get a salad, or i thnk they have [soups] here.
		me: mum, i'll find something.
		[waitress]: what can i get you today?
		me: um, what is you're [soup of the day]?
		waitress: um, today it is the chicken [tortilla soup].
		me:[okayy]..um, can i get a plain salad then, without any meat on it?
		waitress: okay, sure, would you like tomatoes?
		me: sure
		waitress: cheese?
		me: yah
		waitress: bacon [too right]?
		me: no, no meat
		waitress: so chicken then?
		me: no, nothing that was previously alive and breathing,
		waitress: so you want shrimp?
		me: no. i want a plain salad without any meat on it.no animals. none.
		waitress: (very puzzled look on her face)okay, then, [i'll see] what i can do...
		
		basically, if you ever become a vegetarian, DO NOT, i repeat, DO NOT GO TO [APPLEBEES]! you will have a very hard time finding anything to eat, and when you do, it could take a while to order it.

	(2008-01-21 +157/-60)
	One who lives in [the land] of Vegetaria. Often confused as the definition of a person who doesn't [eat meat], but that's only because most [Vegetarians] don't eat meat, either.
		Example: Person 1: Hey, do you want some [steak]?
		Person 2: No, thank you. I don't [eat meat].
		Person 1: Is it because you're a [Vegetarian]?
		Person 2: Hey! Don't be so stereotypical!

	(2003-07-25 +151/-59)
	Often synonymous with [herbivore] or plant-eater.  A person who does not eat parts of dead animals.  Vegetarians correctly do not make a distinction between "[red meat]" and "not red meat", and as such do not consume any kind of seafood or poultry.  Some people who seek to put forward a stoic, [ascetic] or progressive image may claim to be vegetarian while still eating fish or birds.  These poseurs often give themselves the [oxymoronic] label of "pecso-vegetarians".  The reasons for abstaining from animal flesh are typically, ethical, religious, ecological, health-related or economic.  Vegetarians who also shun animal products such as milk, eggs and honey are called vegans (VEE- GEHNS).  Ethical/environmental vegetarians and vegans also often avoid animal-derived goods such as leather, [tallow] in soaps, etc.
		Example: When Bill found out that a meat-based diet uses more [resources] and causes more [pollution] than a [plant-based diet], he went vegetarian.

	(2004-04-21 +3901/-1874)
	A secret underground society that takes pleasure in torturing [fruits] and vegetables. They also are trying to [monopolize] the [bottled water] market.

	(2006-07-30 +184/-89)

	(2004-04-23 +296/-163)
	Someone who does not [eat the meat] of any [animal]. Not even fish or [chicken] as some would like to think.
		Example: I laughed at the silly [omnivore] who said vegetarians were weak because they didn't eat meat.

		Girl: What?
		Guy: A vampire who can't get pussy and can't tell the difference between sucking tomato juice or [animal blood].

	(2008-11-24 +38/-51)
	Fags with fangs who clearly don't understand the fact they're already damned, so 'restraining' from killing humans(also animals) doesn't do shit for their morality/[afterlife]/credibility/personality.
	
	Also, a core vegetarian belief is that the lives of mindless animals are worth the same as those of human beings - So, in theory, being [a veggie] [vamp] doesn't make you a better person because it means the same as if you were feeding like a non-fagcula.
		Example: [Edward Cullen], of [Stephenie Meyer] (in)fam(y)e, refuses to drink the blood of human beings, thinking it makes him 'principled', thus making him a [vegetarian vampire].

		Person 2: That's [not even] [possible]!

	(2006-11-05 +103/-89)
	vegetarianism is an alternative away of life that don't allows people to eat meet and fish. Some people follows it by [ethical] reasons, others follows it for health reasons. [Do'nt] forget that with a vegetarian [diet you] consume proteins that are mostly in meet and fish but you don't consume the fat that eat and fish normally have. and following vegetarianism you are avoiding killing animals.

	A person who does not [eat meat], including birds and fish. Many times [vegetarians] believe that killing animals today for food is immoral and unnecessary because we are able to survive off of other foods. A person who doesn't eat any meat except for fish is a [pescatarian]. A person who doesn't eat any meat or other animal products such as eggs, milk, and cheese is a vegan.

Velociraptor
	(2014-05-17 +50/-4)
	Velociraptors are the most intelligent species of dinosaurs. 12,000 years ago, they built high-tech civilizations and were far more advanced than humans are today. However, their version of the Cold War forced most of the velociraptors to escape into space once a [high caliber] explosive was sent their way. Being such an advanced civilization, the velocirators were able to survive in space and travel from planet to planet. This explosive was responsible for the extinction of every dinosaur (except for the velociraptors, of course). Although the other extremely-advanced velociraptors blamed the explosion on a [meteorite], they died from starvation and life was [restarted]. Now, there are space dinosaurs.

		Example: The [speed]... [oh wait] velocity of the car is 40 [mph].

	(2007-03-26 +91/-24)
	Defined as the change in position of an object (displacement) per unit of time. Velocity, unlike speed, takes into account the direction of travel relative to a base point.
	
	v = [s/t]   (where [v and s] are vectors)
	
	Where (using SI units):
	v is the velocity of the body in metres per second (ms^[-1])
	s is the displacement of the body in metres (m)
	t is the time taken to travel from the initial point to the final point in seconds (s)
		Example: 1. (One dimension) If you start at point A and travel directly north to point B which is ten metres away, and it takes you [five seconds] to get there, your velocity will be [2ms]^[-1] due north.
		
		2. (One dimension) If you travel west for a [ten seconds] at [1ms]^-1, take a break for twenty seconds and then travel for another ten seconds at 1ms^-1, your velocity for the trip will be .05ms^-1 due west.
		
		3. (Two dimension) If you start at point A and travel north at 3kmh^-1 for two hours, and then instantaneously change direction and travel due east for four hours at a speed of 2kmh^-1 to point B, your velocity for the trip is 10kmh^-1 N53¬∞E ([53]¬∞T)
		
		I think...

	(2006-09-15 +62/-42)
	Change in position over change in time. A measure of how fast something is moving. Measured in [m/s], ft/s, [mph] or [km/h].

	(2005-09-06 +28/-3)
	[Escape Velocity]:
	.
	if you throw an object straight up, it will rise until the the negative acceleration of gravity stops it, then returns it to Earth. [Gravity's] force diminishes as distance from the center of the Earth increases, however. So if you can throw the object with enough initial upward velocity so that [gravity's] decreasing force can never quite slow it to a complete stop, its decreasing velocity can always be just high enough to overcome gravity's pull. The initial velocity needed to achieve that condition is called [escape velocity]. 
	.
	From the surface of the Earth, escape velocity (ignoring air friction) is about 7 miles per second, or 25,000 miles per hour. Given that initial speed, an object needs no additional force applied to completely escape Earth's gravity
		Example: 1/2 mv2 = [GMm]/R 
		.
		Where m is the mass of the object, M mass of the earth, G is the gravitational constant, R is the radius of the earth, and v is the [escape velocity]. It simplifies to: 
		.
		v = [sqrt](2GM/R) 
		.
		or 
		.
		v = sqrt(2gR) 
		.
		Where g is acceleration of gravity on the earth's surface. 
		.
		The value evaluates to be approximately: 
		.
		11100 m/s
		40200 km/h
		25000 mi/h

This new style allowed Reed to truly open his work to a new level of emotional attachment.

verbose
	(2009-05-05 +238/-31)
	[Verbosity] is the ability, limited in the general population, to utilize words which may be archaic, lengthy, and in the English language are more often than not based in Latin. Quite often, the phrases used in such a manner are synonymous with much more succinct forms. In addition to the expansive vocabulary utilized, prose which is deemed 'verbose' will quite often feature [parenthetical] phrases in unusual frequency, as might be found in scientific journals or university textbooks. Though accepted in academic contexts for its ability to explain, in great detail, concepts which may seem rather complex to the average layperson, the overuse of excessive [verbosity] will often cause common folk, especially those who might be afflicted with the [neurological disorder] known as Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), to lose interest in the concepts being explained, and thus the knowledge they might gain would be lost to them. Moderation, therefore, is the key to the proper usage of verbosity.
	
	It's good for padding English essays, and there's a type of thread on 4chan that shows up every once in a while where people talk like that for the lulz.
		Example: Person 1: Should you [deign] to learn the definition of [Verbose], one needs only glance upwards, and focus one's eyes on the [paragraph] above.

Verizon
	(2007-12-04 +1030/-195)
	A phone company that releases your private data to the government without a warrant, in violation of the 4th Amendment to the [U.S. Constitution].
	
	When this story broke in October 2006 that Verizon was releasing private [customer data] of U.S. citizens under provisions the "USA Patriot Act}" without warrant, the company [vociferously] denied it.  But in sworn Congressional testimony  (reported in October 2007 in the New York Times), Verizon admitted it decided it could violate the Constitution TENS OF THOUSANDS OF TIMES since 2005, continued up to the present.
	
	The Bush administration is currently (Decemeber 2007) drafting a law that would protect Verizon, AT&T, and others against prosecution.

		"Your [privacy] is never [safe] with Verizon."

	(2011-12-07 +48/-23)
	an archaic company that trades in cable internet and phone service. they force you to stay with them for two years and for what? their packages and prices were reasonable by 2002 standards but now as they are being surpassed by every other company they just start [derping] while the competition leaves them in the dust.
	
	their cable package has no local news and everything is extra. their [dvr] service is shoddy and expensive. their phone service is a different amount every month and leaves you to [guesstimate] how much you want to use your phone.
	the service plans are also laughable. they even charge for [toll free] calls. that being said, they do have excellent coverage, but living on the east coast (or anywhere but [the rockies]) I can get service just as good with a sprint based network. also in canada and europe their service is piss poor.
		Example: 1. bill: I just got [fios] at my house! lets watch hbo.
		later: WTF? I have to buy all the good stuff a la [carte] [what a rip] off
		2. mike: aaah now to watch the ren and stimpy episode I recorded on my [dvr] last night.

		3. ted: now to see how that labor strike played out.
		where's my local news? oh that's right I switched to [verizon]. now all I get is national news that doesn't cover my home state at all.
		4. verizon [derpshit]: Duuuh look I got me a verizon phone, all I had to do was agree to their outrageous prices for two years, Now I gets to buy as many minutes as I want every month and I gets two whole gigabytes of data. that's a lot. I can also call any ten people I want without using minutes.

	[Verizon's] cell phone technical support people are total n00bs, to the point where I know more about what's wrong than they do.
	
	Verizon's DSL service has been reported to slow down below its rated 3.0 [mbps] speed, once you commit to a full year of the DSL service (to save approximately $15/month). If you search Google, you'll find many forums filled with frustrated people who have to wait forever to get through to tech support.
	
	Verizon lures its customers into its DSL service by offering a low monthly price of $30/month (1 year commitment required) for service competitive to [Comcast's] 4 mbps, which is priced at $43/month.
	
	Verizon lures cell phone customers by providing free in-network calling, and [rebates] on cell phone prices. They also say their service is the most reliable wireless network.
		Example: Verizon has a monopoly similar to [Comcast's]. Wouldn't it be funny if they [merged] and then you'd have even [FEWER] choices for internet access?

	(2005-05-16 +36/-112)

	(2007-01-20 +24/-97)
	[Mathematically] inept to the point of not knowing dollars from [cents]. For example, see the YouTube clips where a [succession] of Verizon employees demonstrate they do not know the difference.

		A. They don't realise it's a tax on [verizons].
		
		Q. What does it mean when a footballer says he's going to give 110%?

You then must pay another $10 to have them transfer your information to your [new shit] phone but all the games and internet service you paid for do not go through, and have to pay $5 per game and even more on the internet. Photos also do not get transferred over even though you paid more than [Verizon's] employees get in a year.
	
	This company mostly highers rude fat employees, who make you feel like you are the most retarded person in the world for asking a question.

		Those of the military with [Verizon] if they left for the war and they had to terminate service then they got hit with massive Fees that Verizon said would be null. think about those who've died there.
		the family ends up wit the bill that they said would be excusable because of military.
		
		Horrific Customer Service they will give you nothing but the run a round.
		
		

	(2007-11-20 +43/-46)
	A cell [phone company] who thinks they are so great, when in fact, they actually suck. They lure you into the store with their "hot" new phones like the Chocolate and then a month later your sitting with your new phone realizing you can't do anything [cool with it]. Then you call [Verizon] asking for help, and they act like they couldn't care less. 
	
	Then maybe you record a cool video and want to transfer it to your computer with Bluetooth. Oh wait, you can't because your shitty phone company you went with doesn't allow it. 
	You decide you want to return your phone and get the iPhone wannabe [Voyager]. Then you realize it has the same interface as your chocolate and return it. Now your stuck with a two year contract with a shitty phone company, not to mention all the hidden charges that come along with your already uber-locked down phone.
	
		Example: [AT&T] Customer: "Hey Mike, want me to send you that cool song I just recorded and saved as my [ringtone]."
		
		[VZ] Customer: "Hey sure, Thanks!" (Gets sound 6 hours later after it being sniffed by [Verizon] for possible traces of ripping them off).

Vernon Township High School
	(2012-12-12 +53/-6)
	Vernon Township High School- A High School in [Vernon NJ] where most students that look different, be it wearing a heavy metal shirt, [doc martens] and not being a [aberzombie] preppy idiot will get you in trouble with the faculty.
	It is also the high school a girl got suspended for wearing a 4chan t-shirt since 4chan is considered a terrorist cult by the faculty. Stay away if you have a sense of humor, your own individual taste, are not fully white (since they are racist), and think that a conversation about your trip to abercrombie lasting 3 giggling hours is totally stupid. "Like OHMYGOD you had to see the abs on the boy there, like like"
		Example: I went to Vernon Township High School and now suffer from cold [sweats] and wake up screaming that the [vice principal] who looks like [gollum] is under my bed.

	(2011-03-06 +30/-8)
	Ah [Vernon]. Where to begin? If you value an upstanding institution where students can freely express their opinions and gain an outstanding education, don't go here. We are a people of test-takers. Basically, after finishing an exam of any kind (other then drug tests), our minds [expel] any information it might have once had. Once graduating from Vernon most people stand around and are like, "wtf do i do now?!" Students at VTHS are not prepared to go out into the world. The only place we are destined for is [Sussex] County Community College, where dreams go to die. THANK YOU DRUGS AND FACULTY!
		Example: I went to Vernon Township High School and now I [work] at [a gas] [station].

	(2011-03-06 +20/-7)
	VTHS is a school where most of the extremely caucasion students refuse to accept the fact that there is no African blood in them. Although it is ranked one of the top 10 schools in NJ, anyone who goes here will simply go to [SCCC] just to continue living with their parents, saying that they're going to move to California and yet never do.
	
	Also, you can get a [contact high] just by walking through the halls. Which is pretty bonkers considering the fact that, well, ITS ONE OF THE TOP TEN SCHOOLS IN THE FUCKING STATE. And due to the recent [budget cuts] (THANK YOU CHRISTIE YOU FAT FUCK YOU) this school has gone to an even bigger shit.
		Example: It's funny how the only thing I [learned] to do in Vernon Township High School was how to [hide] [track marks].

	(2008-10-11 +126/-57)
	You walk out your four bedroom house onto your quiet street, with [all but one] little [soccer mom van] driving down. [the soccer mom] waves to you, and instinct forces to wave back, because that happens to be your mom's best friend, your [math teacher's] sister, and of course, exboyfriend or girlfriend's mom. Welcome to Verona, NJ, population 14,500 people.
	
	This is a town were everyone is realated, everyone knows eachother, and even if you haven't met a person, you know EVERYTHING about them. In this town, the population is 75% white, italian, irish; 13% [asian 5]% black 2% spanish/hispanic 5% indian. Basically everyone is Catholic, going to [Our Lady] of the Lake or Saint [Catherine's]. This town would be nothing without [Bloomfield] Avenue, the heart of Verona. 
	
	The youth of Verona keeps the town in tact. The town is broken up into four parts by elementry school, Forest, [Brookdale], [Laning], and [FN] Brown. Forest and Brookdale tend to be close, same with Laning and FN Brown. After graduating elementry school, the best years of your life, you go to the middle school. Henry B Whitehorne is known as some of the WORST years of your life. Some of the well-known teachers make those years good, but usually the bad teachers outnumber them. And the principal will make your years a living hell. In middle school, everyone comes together and loose their elementry cliques. From 6th to 8th grade, you hang out at Cinema 23, and meet the kids from [Cedar Grove], our neighboring town.
	
	Once your days at [HBW] are over, you head on down to the High School, Verona High School. This is when your real life starts. Parties every weekend, drinks included. Most kids choose to get high and drink at Split and Lookout, but some kids. who'se unaware parents like to leave them home alone, choose to throw their own parties and drink the entire stock of their parents alcohol. By high school, you loose touch with [CG] and become close friends with the grades above you. As a freshman, you are mostly picked on by the Juniors and Seniors, and some upperclassmen take advantage of these freshman, trying to "get with them" on weekends. [MDW] and Prom weekend hold the record for the most passouts and blackouts.
	
	Verona football games are the most notortious events of the school year. Kids tailgate at the pool parking lot and other places and then head over to the Verona [football field] to scream their drunk butts off at the opposing team. Verona kids who do this are know as those who "rule the bleachers" Freshman [stand at] the bottom and are slaves to the uppper classmen who sit at the top. They fetch water and gatorade and then get [sun flower] seeds and drinks spit out at them.
	
	After high school is long over, kids go off to nothing special colleges to go on to become teachers and community workers. They eventually migrate back to Verona where they repeat the circle of Verona life with their "out of town" spouses. Then their kids live out the same miserable life as their parents did.
	
	Verona is a nothing special suburb where there is most drama than your average suburban town and more wannabe Guidos than the Jersey shore, which is a second home to many Verona families. If you ever consider going to Verona, do not:
	
	1. Trust the first people you meet.
	2. Lurk everyone on Facebook/Myspace
	3. Make your self seem badass to "fit in"
	4. Be fake
	5. Take obscure pictures of your self, mainly chest area, for you will only be judged even worse.
	
	Welcome to Verona, where you will be judged worse than [Simon Cowell] on American Idol...
		Example: "Hey man, what are you doing Friday night?"
		
		"I was thinking about going to [Spilt], you coming?"
		
		"Hell yes, i plan on getting totally wasted before [tomorrow's] Verona football game"
		
		"I hope [no beat] freshman come"
		
		"You know bro."

	(2006-11-29 +79/-53)
	A suburb of [Madison, WI]. The city itself has an area of approximately 3 sq. miles and has a population of little more than 7,000 (according to the 2000 Census [Bureau]). 97% of it's residents are white, and there is less than 1% of every other classified race.
	
	[Verona's] teenagers attend Verona Area High School, a school revered by oversheltering parents as a [safe haven] for their teenagers, as it has less physical violence than [Madison's] high schools, West and Memorial. However, the typical Verona High student, although free from physical violence, is probably just as corrupt as their West or Memorial counterpart.
	
	A typical female Verona High student is either pregnant or good with [contraceptive] use, and will not hesitate to look at you from top to bottom to not-so-conspicuously judge what you're wearing. Due to Verona [High's] diminutive size, there are many rumors spread throughout the school.
	
	A Verona girl will probably be proud enough of her boyfriend to take far too many pictures of herself with him, upload them to her Myspace, and have to delete them within a few weeks. After a week-long breakup process, the cycle repeats with a different Verona boy. Such is similar to a female's 28-day menstrual cycle.
	
	To be a Verona girl who can attract a Verona boy, you must be aesthetically pleasing by American society standards; Verona boys are incredibly shallow and overwhelmingly dramatic. A Verona boy may declare his love to you [at the drop of a hat], but if you [shave your head], you've pretty much lost all value as a person.
	
	Because Verona has absolutely nowhere interesting to go shopping, many of Verona's teens will frequent the West [Towne] Mall in Madison during summer and weekends. This is about as close to being unsheltered from Verona as they get. Shopping at Hot Topic is considered extremely alternative-cultured. Some may consider it pathetic to be so ignorant of the non-Verona world around you, but since they're too enclosed in Verona, they don't know what they're missing and they're probably happy.
	
	The Verona teens who try to rebel will typically overemphasize drug use (i.e. telling people they are not "weed virgins" after inhaling [secondhand weed] smoke) and stay out "late" (10 or 11 PM is considered "late") doing absolutely nothing. This scares the majority of Verona parents, so I guess they get what they want.
		Example: [VERONA] GIRL: Hi, my name is (Jessica/Ashley/Brittany/some other stereotypical modern [white girl's] name) and I'm from [Verona]. On weekends, I like going to Hot Topic and getting myself alternative clothing because it makes me different from people. I love my boyfriend, (Robert/Jake/Matt/some other stereotypical modern [white guy's] name). We have a lot of history in the two weeks we've been dating.
		
		VERONA BOY: Hi, my name is (Robert/Jake/Matt/some other stereotypical modern white guy's name), and I'm from Verona. You may have seen me getting major [highs] from [this guy's] weed last night; I was inhaling so much of his smoke. My girlfriend, (Jessica/Ashley/Brittany/some other stereotypical modern white girl's name), and I went out and stayed on the Verona campus until [10:30] one night, it was so awesome and rebellious. I had another girlfriend, (Jessica/Ashley/Brittany/some other stereotypical modern white girl's name), but she got all weird and shaved her head so she's not a good person anymore. I'm going to play one of the three Fenders my parents bought me, even though I have no idea how to play guitar.

	(2008-06-19 +39/-27)
	A small town located in north-eastern New Jersey, where everybody knows each other, and everyone grows up together. The town is separated into four different sections based on the closest elementary school, these being [Laning], Forest, [Brookdale], and F.N.Brown. Eventually after years of kickball, field days, and pizza lunches everybody moves up to middle school, called H.B.W. It stands for Henry B. Whitehorne, and nobody really knows what the "B" stands for. This is were everybody gets real friends, and actually start to mature. Next step, Verona High School. VHS is packed with school spirit, where you can always find somebody wearing something to go with the Hillbillies, or Verona. All the high schoolers, or at least a lot of them gather at the football games to cheer on the bleachers, seniors at the top, to freshmen at the bottom. Here everyone goes all out, to wearing a hillbilly costume, or painting there stomachs, their is always a good chance somebody will lose their voice at a Friday night game. Thanksgiving games are usually one of the most [nerve-racking] games of the year, excluding playoffs, where everyone in town, which is hardly anybody, comes out to watch the game played against the neighboring and rival town [Cedar Grove]. Even though Cedar Grove and Verona are truly rivals, in sports that is, the two towns should probably be combined, due to the fact everyone knowns everyone and everybody hangs out together on weekends. While football is the most popular sport in VHS, Verona Cross Country and [Track Team] are amazing, breaking records every year, and having some of the best members in the state. Band is deff. the other major thing to do, and if you don't do either your just screwed up. [Memorial Day Weekend], one of the most anticipated weeks of the year, is the most crazy. Either partying in somebody's basement, or at [Point Pleasant], [Belmar], Seaside everyone is sure to have a good, crazy, and probably drunk time. Every other night you can find somebody at the [Willowbrook] Mall, walking the streets aimlessly, sitting around, or eating up at [the Pilgrim] Diner, the best diner around. Here, you can get your cheese or gravy fries, or famous [disco fries] and slurp a delicious black and white shake. Summer, the best time of year. You can hang out with friends at the Verona [Community Pool], which is for sure the nicest pool around, which is ten times better than Cedar [Groves] pool. Consisting of a tennis court, a volleyball court, a basketball court, a snack bar, two actually [big water] slides, two low diving boards, and one [high dive], which all the little kids try to sneak on to. Or during the summer you go dts, primarily to you or your friends shore house at [Long Beach Island] or Belmar. Graduations from high school are tear-filled and heart-felt,  but exciting at the same time. Pictures are taken, caps are thrown, beachballs fly around above the class, and blow horns are heard, and later that night the never ending sound of honking fills the streets. Later that night the seniors attend "Project Graduation", something they have each year, in which they have been raising money for the whole year, including the ever popular high school carnival. Being a senior is the high point in your high school career. Your preparing for college, your classes are a bunch of jokes, you write on the driveway, while praying not to be caught by the cops even though you kind-of want to be, banquets occur every other night, and you pick on the new freshmen who try to be cool. Verona, a town the lives off drama and football, a is extremely close knit, but nobody who lives here would want it any other way.
		Example: Verona [Hillbillies] [Football Team] just [won] state! ... AGAIN!

		I was on the [Divvy] Road (Divinity Road, what they would refer to as their "hood" thinking they're ironically cool, we [all call] it a street) the other day and a versace of sloanes went past in a convoy of Golfs.
		
		I tell you, if you want to see a versace of sloanes you should pop into Oxford during term time, they all go to "[Brookes] University" so that their parents can say that they go to "Oxford".

vette
	(2005-07-29 +169/-35)
	[Short] [version] of the [Corvette].
		Example: 1953-?
		[C5] Z/06: 1.[0g] skidpad stock (@ 15k less than a Porsche and 220k less than a Ferrari)
		
		C3 [ZL-1]: 0-60 in 3.6 sec, 1/4-mile in 10.6 sec @ 125+ mph

	(2005-08-16 +53/-15)
	A car designed by a guy who has won some very prestigous European races and was good enough for the likes of such people as [Buggati] and [Ferdinand Porsche]. [Zora] Arkus-Duntov.
		Example: The 'Vette has won [LeMans] a few good times over the years. The 'Vette [ZL-1] is also one of the fastest cars ever made. The '06 Z/06 will be one of the best handling cars in the world. Plus, it will cost 1/5th that of a [base model] Ferrari. Now, I only make $80k a year, so it is much more in my price range. I could get a marginally-better performing Ferrari, Porsche, or Lambo if I won the lottery, seeing as the cost 225k, but I doubt that'll happen so I'll stick with a tried & true sports car classic that pulls 0.97g on the skid pad stock and gets to 60 in the low 4-second range.

	(2005-09-15 +80/-27)
	Short name for the Chevy [Corvette]. Made from 1953 to now. Has and has always had incredible handling, on par with most European sports cars. Same goes for acceleration, only better. The 1990-95 ZR-1 Corvette, complete with a 405hp 5.7-liter overhead cam V8, could pull OVER 1.[0g] on the skidpad... completely stock. The 1969 aluminum-engined [ZL-1] featured [50/50] weight distribtion and it's L88-based [427] V8 produced over 450hp at the wheels. It could hit 60mph in the high 3-second range and could run the 1/4-mile in 10.5 @ 133mph; the only mod being drag [slicks], which, I'd like to point out, are inferior to modern racing tires. With modern tires... Who knows? The ZL-1 could top over 180mph with proper [gearing] and could pull about 0.94g on the skidpad. Not bad, for 1969.
		Example: I knew this guy who had a '71 ZR-2 [Corvette]. That thing got to 60mph in 5 seconds flat, thanks to it's 425hp [LS6] [V8 engine]. It could also take the corners with the best of them.
		
		One last thing, in 1973 Car&Driver compared a Jag, a Ferrari, a Porsche, and a Mercedes. The 'Vette out-ran, out-cornered, and out-brake them all.

	(2003-11-13 +167/-66)
	The shortened name for the greatest vehicle ever to roam the lands, the [Corvette].  A stylish blend of luxury, power, and grace, all at [reasonable price] (only by comparison to the likes of its competition...porsche, ferrari, [viper])
		Example: I [pulled up] next to this hot chick in my vette the other day and looked into her car to see her [fiddling] her bean over me and my hot ride!  I told her it was ok to join me in my vette, so she did, and [we banged].

	(2008-01-30 +33/-20)
	Short For [Corvette], The BEST Car in [the Universe] [period].
		Example: A [Lingenfelter] [Corvette] can do 300MPH and still cost less than a stock european [sports car].

	(2004-10-17 +39/-30)
	let's straighten out all you unknowlegable [dingle berrys].
	
	First off, the vette has and always will have an amazing suspenion.  the c5 z06 pulled a full 1.[0g] on the skid pad stock.
	
	Secondly the vette is fast in a straight line as well, it can run an 11.6 in [the quarter mile] stock.
	
	now that you have all been enlightened a little bit, go buy a vette, then judge it.
		Example: "Wow that vette hadles the turns like no car i have ever seen."
		
		"The full 1.[0g] and [51/49] balance are probably why"
		
		"but damn it's fast in [the quarter mile] too"
		
		"a vette is a well rounded car"

	(2004-02-21 +32/-82)
	Shortened name for the Corvette. One of the few [american cars] that has any sort of overseas fanbase. Contrary to what many ignorant 'vette fans think, it is no-where near the same league as european uber-brans such as Ferrari, Porsche or even many [beamers] or benz'.
	
	
	While it may go fast in a straight line, look [like a shark], and help one to get blown, it is still crap.
	
	
	Being that it is an american sports car, it suffers from "suspionus americanas sportas". Due to a lack of suspension, it gives a terrible ride (your spine will be totally destroyed within a year of buying it), rattles like an old man getting out of bed, and steers like, well, an american car. Due to the fact this was designed for racing in the broad streets of the good ol' USA, it sucks as a REAL race car, and on the narrower hills of europe, would probably get owned by [a mini cooper].
	
	
	Apparantly prone to malfunction.
		Example: [America's] [half-assed] answer to the [911]?
		
		
		Maybe not.

	(2003-10-18 +16/-64)
	A Shortened form of the American "[Corvette]". Apparently it was [meant to be] a [sports car].

		Example: Jeff: "Hey Abby did you see the new [Tiesto] video?"

	Adj: [sucky]
		Example: "You [fuckin'] [vevo]"
		"[that shit] is fuckin' vevo"

	(2012-01-13 +52/-85)
	A company that allows artists on youtube to [monetize] their online [music videos] with the use of 5-15 second ads. In exchange, the videos are free to watch and are always high quality, never being less than [360p] and commonly being as high as [1080p].
	
	For some reason it has gained a large amount of [irrational hatred] because of the apparent "corporate" feel it gives to youtube, a company owned by a corporation. For some reason people find it crazy that an artists would want to earn some compensation for their popular and free to view videos, especially considering Internet is largely surpassing television and most music channels are notorious for never playing music videos anyway, and that "option" leaves you with 2-3 minutes of commercials.
	Vevo is only applied to singles, the music videos which would [garner] the most attention, so its understandable that the artists would want to be able to profit off of its popularity without purchases. Also, ads before videos are short, never lasting more than [15 seconds], and many lasting only 5 before allowing the viewer to skip. For some reason though this waiting is too much for the "entitled" viewer.
	
	Vevo isn't a sign of greed, but advancement in [the industry]. Music video fans can now view any video they want, in high quality, and only be separated by mere seconds of ads, and not be charged a dime, and the artists can receive the revenue they have earned.
	
	People trying to make money off of something they put effort into? RIDICULOUS!
		Example: Person 1: Oh god, not another [vevo] vid!
		Person 2: What, you hate vevo?
		Person 1: Yea, of course, so many [stupid ads], I just want to watch the video.
		Person 2: What's wrong with vevo, the artists are getting the money they rightfully deserve, especially considering most people don't even BUY music anymore.
		Person 1: Yea but still, youtube is just a big corporation now.
		Person 2: Youtube always was a corporation, and by the way, the [ad's] already done, put it to [720p].

	(2011-01-14 +64/-232)
	Company that puts HIGH QUALITY OFFICIAL music vids on youtube. Not just sweet sweet audio chocolate, but also something cool to watch while your ears are cumming. Now stay with me plz, although this isnt an angry person saying angry things post that by reading will make you feel better about being pissed at [vevo]. Ill admit the mini-ads can get annoying, but its waay better to watch the good stuff by vevo than browse through fake titled or shitty quality songs, esp. some losers remix/cover. All you gotta do is click the vevo vid at the top of your search, wait 10-15 secs for that diabolical ad to finish, then enjoy [the vid] and ‚Äú[rape the replay button]‚Äù without seeing the ad again. I personally keep like 10 songs up at a time in different tabs. Yeah so I think if ppl look at vevo in that way theyll be happier and not annoyed/frustrated at the ads, like I used to be before I put some thought into it. Plus im [baked as fuck], bored, and sick of seeing comments complaining about vevo. XD
		Example: [Retardo] [McGhee]: *typing youtube comment* ‚Äúzomgbitchwhiiiinebitch [vevo] needs to get their corporate asses off youtube blah blah greedy blah blah blah give me a thumbs up and we will get vevo to leave youtube‚Äù
		Will: (2 minutes later) Wow thats already the highest rated comment. Its really annoying that half the top rated youtube comments these days are idiots whining about vevo. Thats possibly the worst thing about vevo. Ppl should know that their immature rants wont force it off youtube; its here to stay.
		Retardo McGhee: *drools* Dood vevo is teh DEVIL!!
		Will: *eye twitches* Hmmm. K just think of it this way: youre still getting free music on youtube, but also helping the artist you like/love/wanna fuck make some dough.
		Retardo McGhee: [Gahh] okie dokie. Mmm [Tyler Glenn].
		Will: Fag.

It has so much power that the [Bugatti Veyron] needs two keys to use all of its power.  If you reach its top speed the tires will begin to melt and a whole tank of gas will be gone in a matter of minutes.

At the cost of 5 million per unit, and sale price of 1.5 million, one would think that the over-analyzing Germans would have spotted the fault in their calculations. The car itself is really a shmorgasboard of parts from the Volkswagen and Audi production bins, and contrary to popular belief it actually generates [997] horsepower. This is fairly pathetic value considering that Volkswagen [piled] on 4 turbochargers onto 2 engines.

		GODDAM IT! *flips to comedy central

	(2004-01-06 +121/-29)
	The channel [MTV] [should of] been. VH1 has a good variety of shows that have to do with music! MTV is like satan reincarnated into a "music" channel. [oops]! I mean a "reality" TV channel.
		Example: [MTV], [TRL], The Real World, and [Road Rules] all suck A$$! I want my VH1!

	Simply put: Trash. Well, They do have some good [top ten] music previews, but all of their reality shows are [pure trash]. most of the people on the shows act like they live in the urban/uptown areas or are from a completely different country ([imports]). In most of the shows like [rock of love], [I love money] and [charm school], they often have the following in common:
	
	-stupid, territorial, woman with big boobs in low cut/skin tight shirts/skirts (see trashy or ghetto).
	-rich male hosts who are often players and music producers (not many people know them though). They often enjoy it when the girls they are hosting with fight and then toss them away when they no longer can get any in between episodes.
	-TV Time
	-The [cliche's]: "I'm so confused", "I'm here to win", "I will do everything I can to make you feel better", "Time to be exposed", "I dunno what im gonna do", "I really wanna get to know (insert host name here)", "omg [im going home] tonight", "she/he should go home", "I'm not here for friends," or "I'm here for (insert host name here)".
	-rap/music producers who host the shows suck sooo bad. 
	-All the people on the shows have a fake "username" describing their personality.
	-Unnecessary profanity? (probably to make it seem real)
	-Little "shocker cutscenes" that appear every time someone says an offensive line or pun.
	-Fighting, but ONLY between woman (the guys on the shows like I love money never fight)
	-Lot's of alcohol trashed up to look like expensive wine.
	-Most of the shows have the word "of love" in it and the titles look like they were made in photoshop.
	-Are interchangeable with each other and often trade characters
	-Everyone is forces to live together in a mansion of some sort... Of course for more drama given that they are only supplied limited resources.
	
		Example: -Guy 1: Turns to VH1
		
		-Guy 2: "Ugh dude not again..."
		
		-Guy 1: "What's wrong with VH1"
		
		-Guy 2: "Dude it's fake. Everyone on that channel has an IQ of a squirrel and the chicks look like rejected [imports] from my old playboy magazine. You know those 'dating' shows are based off of [Polygamy] right?"
		
		-Guy 2: "Woah dude omg! Check out that girls boobs! [I'd tap that]!"
		
		-Guy 1: "Nevermind... I'ma go get something out of the fridge. You want somethin?"

Viagra Triangle
	(2008-09-09 +546/-76)
	A sub set of the "[Rush Street]" nightlife district on Chicago's Near North Side.  So named for the abundance of mostly-affluent older men who frequent the local bars, and the "triangle" where State and Rush Streets come together (with East Bellevue Street being the base of the triangle, anchored by [Gibson's] restaurant, the unofficial headquarters).  
	
	The gentle ecosystem of the Viagra Triangle could not exist without a fully-stocked pond of anxious, and artificially infertile females.  Seven years prior she may have been called a "Trixie" in and around Lincoln Park, but with an East Bank membership, a [Platinum card] of her own, and several upgrades to the base Lexus, she is looking for more, while her looks and latest Botox treatment hold out).
	
	Though, claimed as fact in other definitions, it is extremely rare to see participants in the Viagra Triangle scene parking their behinds, much less their Flying Spurs and [911s], anywhere south of Oak Street or North of Cedar.  The important, and notable exception is when the bars in the triangle close, and he has not yet [sealed the deal].  In such cases, overtime must be played at [The Lodge] on Division Street, which is open til every bit of 4AM during the week and 5AM on the weekends ("if three bottles of Cristal have not done the job, maybe a few PBRs will," is the thinking).
		Example: Seriously, guy, you're [never going] to get anywhere with [the chicks] in the Viagra Triangle, they all require a personal [financial] statement before sitting down.

Vicodin
	(2015-03-28 +74/-21)
	A DEA schedule 2 (CII) narcotic (opioid) pain [reliever] consisting of [hydrocodone] bitartrate and [acetaminophen]. Was one of the most prescibed medications
		Example: My doctor won't give me Vicodin any more because he's afraid of the [DEA]! He will only give me [Tylenol 3], which sucks! [Dammit]!

	(2006-07-15 +2354/-1234)
	A perscription, schedule III, narcotic [analgestic] (pain killer) containing hydrocodone and [acetaminophen] (Tylenol). Hydrocodone is actually an opiate, like heroin, that gives an amazing euphoric [body high] but it's also very addictive (although not nearly as addictive as heroin). Vicodin also has very severe withdrawal effects, similar to those of heroin, although not as severe. 
	
	Vicodin is perscribed for mild to severe pain often after a surgery, but sometimes for long-term use. Vicodin is produced by [Knoll] Labratories and comes in three varieties. Vicodin (5 mg hydrocodone, 500 mg acetaminophen), [Vicodin ES] (7.5/750), Vicodin HP (10/660). There is also many generic variants of Vicodin. 
	
	Vicodin is often taken for recreational use because it gives an amazing, euphoric body high. Vicodin is most commonly taken orally in pill form or crushed up and [insufflated] (snorted). Snorting results in slightly more powerful effects which come into effect much faster. [Acetaminophen] is extremely harmful to the liver in high doses (2,000+ mg) so often times, for recreational use, people will extract the hydrocodone from the pill resulting in an extremely vile liquid which can be taken orally or rectally via syringe (not very common, but people do it). 
	
	The most common side effects include itching, nausea, paranoia, and intense sweating even if it's not really hot. The severity of the side effects depends on [the dose] taken. 10-15 mg is considered a moderate dose and 20-30 mg is a high dose. Some people will even take around 60 mg but this isn't very smart because the side effects will be so severe you will not enjoy the experience at all. 
		Example: Two or three tabs of Vicodin [HP] will give you a great, [euphoric] [body high]. 

	(2008-12-17 +1023/-828)
	A really great [painkiller] with heroin like properties. Perfect for putting up with idiot co-workers and [micro-managing] bosses. Makes getting out of bed everyday worth the [hassle]!
		Example: Its [easy to] get [vicodin] if you do a 'lil [doctor shopping]!

	(2015-05-23 +16/-11)
	Vicodin is a narcotic pain killer prescribed for moderate to severe pain. Contains either 5, 7.5 or 10 mg of hydrocodone (opiate) and 500 - 660 mg tylenol (analgesic). Also is the most common drug that leads people to a progressive opiate addiction problem usually begins with Vicodin then leads to percocet, then morphine and or pure oxycodone. Also the most used opiate for recreational use due to its desirable [euphoric high] and also its almost universal availability due to it being the #1 opiate prescribed for everything from a [toothache] to a [broken bone] or even a post=operative pain remedy.
		Example: Man Vicodin [sure does] [help with] pain but shit loads of people have became drug addicts from [taking it] too...

	(2009-11-16 +219/-274)
	[Vicodin] is a prescription opiate [painkiller] typically prescribed for pain associated with surgery. When taken long term it can be very addictive.
	
	When used as directed for pain, it does a very nice job of eliminating pain and producing a calm feeling that it both unobtrusive and pleasant.
	When taken [recreationally] in low doses, a feeling of tiredness washes over one typically 1-2 hours after ingestion. If you lie down, you feel very understanding, calm, and may feel like you have the solution to every problem in the world. You will not be able to sleep, even though you feel very tired. [Dry mouth] often occurs, and a mild hangover is not uncommon.
	When taken in high doses recreationally, an overpowering feeling of fatigue will force you to a bed or chair. An extremely strong wave of warmth and "fuzzy tinglies" wash over you. You feel like you have never been this [stoned in] your life. It will make you very stupid, and even unable to speak or think properly. A strong hangover will greet you the next day.
	
	Warnings: In high doses, the acetominophen (tylenol) in [vicodin] is very toxic to your liver, so it's [not a good idea] to drink alcohol when under vicodin influence. Also, addiction to vicodin is not uncommon (anyone who's seen house knows what I mean). It can reduce your ability to do simple tasks, such as using the bathroom (I found that out the hard way). It is very fun though. Enjoy
		Example: Steve: Hey mike you got the [vicodin]?
		Mike: Yeah man. You want a high or low dose?
		Steve: [I'm looking] to be stoned dude. 8 pills please.
		Mike: [Here you go]. I'll just take four.
		
		Steve: See you in Mars dude.

	(2009-10-24 +123/-172)
	Narcotic (that is, opiate) pain reliever (see 'oxycodone') that the FDA took off the market... not because of its opiate properties (which will block your pain or, if you're not in pain, get you high), but because the company that makes it, to preserve their [copywrite] and keep it from becoming generic (our slogan: "profits ahead of people"), added enough aceteminophen (Tylenol, [APAP]) to it to fry your liver. For [chronic pain] patients, oxycodone is great stuff, and [so lots] of people were put on Vicodin (the company bribed doctors with freebies and trips, etc., to prescribe it instead of generic oxycodone, that costs less)... then their patients started suffering liver failures and dying. Oh well... they'd made their profits.
		Example: I'm one of those [chronic pain] patients (6 spine surgeries) and don't get high at all from opiates-- the body is smart enough to aim the narcotics at the pain first. If [there isn't any] pain, you will get high as a kite on 5% of what I take daily... But the acetominophen in the Vicodin would have blown out my liver and killed me, and all for the sake of the multinational pharmaceutical [firm's] profit/loss margin.
		
		And when you hear this crap about how they have to charge so much because of research costs, try to get a comparison of research and marketing costs for the same drug. Good luck.

	(2005-07-01 +914/-801)
	A [painkiller] that is typically prescribed for pain associated with surgery, such as the removal of [wisdom teeth]. It's very effective, but can become addicting. [Matthew Perry] was addicted to vicodin at one point. Eminem has vicodin tattooed on his arm.
		Example: I was [prescribed] [1-2] pills of vicodin every [4 hours] for mouth pain.

	(2005-06-30 +714/-689)
	[a pill] commonly combined to [help with] tylonol to help ease pain. They also make you [numb] and happy.
		Example: Wow [Napoleon Dynamite] is so much [better] when you [take] vicodin

	(2003-12-04 +415/-502)
	A [painkiller] [prescribed] for mild to severe pain.
	
	But to most people that take em they are known as [fluff], scratch and im sure people have came up with many more creative slang/... if you know of anymore please add.
		Example: ex.1) eh.. got any scratch?
		
		ex.2) I took four [tabs] and im [fluffing] [like a motherfucker]

	(2005-10-11 +324/-406)

_____

Vicoprofen
	(2011-04-11 +280/-99)
	[Vicoprofen] is related to Vicodin but a little stronger and less harmful.
	A standard vicodin is 5/500 which means 5 mg. [hydrocodone] and 500 mg [acetaminophen]. So it's a low dose of narcotic pain reliever and a lot of Tylenol which is very bad for your liver.
	Vicoprofen is 7.5 mg hydrocodone (narcotic pain killer) and 200 mg. ibuprofen (nowhere as bad for you as acetaminophen).
	DO NOT take a bunch of these at once. ONE will make you extremely warm, fuzzy, worry-free, and happy. You will probably feel nauseous about 10 min after you take it, then over the next 10 or 20 min the nausea will fade away and you will feel waves of warmth and euphoria washing over you. If you take too much hydrocodone (vicodin, [vicoprofen], [norco], [lortab], lorcet, etc) you will just feel drugged and tired, without much of a euphoria or high.
	Do not crush up and snort these painkillers as you can get a rush that just lasts a short time but can cause your breathing and heart to slow down so much you could possibly die. Instead take them with food and water and enjoy the 2 to 4 hour slow easy smooth warm happy buzz.
	
	A lot of people are confused about oxycodone and hydrocodone.
	
	Oxycodone is in Percocet, Percodan, Oxycontin. It is stronger than hydrocodone.
	
	[Hydrocodone] is in Vicodin, Vicoprofen, [Norco], [Lortab], Lorcet, etc. It is not as strong as oxycodone but still a potent painkiller.
		Example: Don't take too many vicodins, there's a ton of [acetaminophen] in them that can damage your [liver]. Vicoprofen is not as [harmful].

	(2016-05-11 +51/-12)
	[Victimism] can similarly be defined as a kind of philosophy whereby one chooses to perpetually see one's self as a victim of some sort for the purpose of accruing sympathy and empathy. The ultimate purpose of [victimism] is simply to attain social power, influence, and status by [exploiting] the well meaning sympathies and good intentions of the general [populace] for its social/political support. If one "plays the victim" one can gain power and influence by exploiting the sympathies of the masses.
		Example: The newly coined term of "[mansplaining]" supports an overarching philosophy of [victimism] employed to great effect by feminists. [Mansplaining] is a passive/aggressive ploy to silence men by claiming victimization whenever, in the course of ordinary conversation, a man interrupts a woman when she's speaking. The evil act of mansplaining only ever occurs if a man interrupts a woman. It never happens when a man interrupts another man or a woman interrupts another woman. In those cases no victimization has occurred because a man hasn't taken the occasion to "[victimize]" a woman. Any interruption is a bit rude and confrontational , as we all know; but it's also a [pretty standard] part of human debating and discussion. However, if a man ever interrupts a woman for any reason ever, a "crime" has taken place. If you ask the woman, she'll explain at great length about her victimization whereas the man will simply shrug his shoulders and wonder what the big deal is.

victim blaming
	(2016-03-07 +56/-27)
	[Victim blaming] is blaming the victim for a crime they didn't [commit]. Victim blaming is being blamed for somebody [else's] actions.
		Example: Think of victim blaming as when someone's [raped], they (police, judge, [counselor], whoever) always ask the victim what they were wearing, how they were [wearing it], etc.

	(2018-04-17 +48/-59)
	[Victim Blaming] (or [victim shaming]) is when people blame someone for getting themselves hurt or into a bad situation. Since people have no way to refute the argument that the victim should've taken more [precaution] they use an invented term like "Victim Blaming".
	
	We can all take more precaution in every dangerous action we engage in - whether that's driving (drive slower), climbing a ladder (have someone hold it), or any activity in which there is a possibility that something can go wrong and result in injury.
	
	The "Victim Blaming" term also insists that the victim suffered through no fault of their own. In other words, the victim is not responsible for anything that happens to them and simply pointing out that more caution should've been exercised makes you a bad person. People who are accused of "[victim blaming]" are not excusing the behavior the [aggressor], which is often misunderstood by people who simply shout "victim blaming" at others.
		Example: Person1: That Lion tore my arm off when I was just walking through the jungle minding my own business.
		
		Person2: We'll you shouldn't be walking through the jungle alone without protection. [That's dumb].
		Person1: You're [victim blaming] asshole!
		Person2: No, I just think [it's common sense] to not put yourself in danger. Even I don't walk through the jungle alone.
		
		Person1: [Victim Blaming]!
		
		Person2: I didn't want you to lose your arm, I'm just pointing out the simple fact that, had you been more cautious, you might still have your arm. I only mention it so you and others might be more careful next time.
		Person1: Rapist! Bigot! Racist! I hope a lion tears your arm off.
		
		Person2: *Facepalm*

	(2015-12-08 +25/-48)
	Victim blaming is when you rape a woman and then [accuse] her,because she was dressed like a slut and obviously wanted to be raped.This is often creating a [Slutwalk] and would be normal in a [Rape Culture].

Victim Shaming
	(2011-12-15 +95/-34)
	When the victim of an event is blamed, or partially blamed, for their own attack. Mainly used in context with rape, [domestic abuse], sexual harassment and sexual assault, but can be applied to other situations. It wrongly shifts blame from the guilty party onto the victim, and therefore doesn't (or makes it more difficult to) punish the one truly at fault. The term was popularized by the [SlutWalk] movement, which started after a Canadian police officer advised female students to "avoid dressing like sluts" in order to avoid being [victimized].
		Example: Person#1: "I know being raped is bad and all, but she was flirting with him the whole night, and wearing that [low-cut shirt]. [What'd] she expect?"
		
		Person#2: "Dude, sex has NOTHING to do with rape. It's all about power. And even if it did, flirting and wearing a low-cut top doesn't mean she was asking to be attacked like that. So, why don't you quit the [victim shaming] and admit what that guy did was wrong."

victimhood
	(2004-03-20 +177/-80)

Victimism
	(2016-05-11 +51/-12)
	[Victimism] can similarly be defined as a kind of philosophy whereby one chooses to perpetually see one's self as a victim of some sort for the purpose of accruing sympathy and empathy. The ultimate purpose of [victimism] is simply to attain social power, influence, and status by [exploiting] the well meaning sympathies and good intentions of the general [populace] for its social/political support. If one "plays the victim" one can gain power and influence by exploiting the sympathies of the masses.
		Example: The newly coined term of "[mansplaining]" supports an overarching philosophy of [victimism] employed to great effect by feminists.

	When one or group live in a perpetual state of anxiety, worry, anger and hate because they feel they are owed something by someone or something.
	
	A [Victimist] can range from a welfare-taking bum to a pompous, selfish rich asshole to the spoilt middle-class emo. They often vague in their grievances and don't know how to solve themselves. They are unintelligent, idle, lazy but perceive themselves differently. They are easily swept up by biased media outlets e.g. Fox News and other mainstream bullshit like the "[Tea Party Movement]". They'll happily complain without knowing the facts and they'll tell lies to benefit themselves. They are more [emotive] than rational.
	
	They feel [hard done by] society so they choose to sit on the sidelines and complain about it. They are often "pathetic" in the pure sense of the word. "FML" is popular term used by Victimists.They are the type of people who argue in internet chatrooms (Youtube) with other Victimists.
	
	Victimists are related closely with people who complain about "political correctness". They are the ones who start racist [facebook groups] complaining "about the immigrants taking their jobs" or "the muslims taking over" or "Black people say N***** so why can't I say it!?"
	
	Furthermore, Victimism is a cousin of Individualism in the sense that the motives behind them are for their own personal gain.
		Example: [Welfare Bum]: I can't work because I won't have enough time to watch TV and eat junk food. I'm stressed out enough as it is ok! I have a sore back and find it [too too] painful to work! Benefits are too low and need to be raised! The government doesn't care about poor people! Cries
		
		Rich Asshole: OMG The government are taking all my money and giving it to dirty, poor people. I don't want to pay for government services for folks poorer than myself, leave me alone! The government wants to turn us into Socialists! Cries
		
		Middle-Class Emo: Life is so hard. I have my parents [in my ear] about my exams and the girl I have been talking to on Facebook for ages won't respond to me anymore. On top of that, my parents won't let me go travelling for 9 months! FML. Yeah man [fuck society]! Society sucks! Everyone is a dick. I have it all figured out. Really Loud Cries
		
		Normal, rational person:^ All of those idiots above are perpetuating Victimism.

Victoria, TX
	(2010-07-01 +126/-30)
	the shit [stain] on the wonderful [tapestry] that is the state of [Texas]
		Example: One day, god set out to create one of the most beautiful things in the world. He decided he would call it "Texas". He painted rolling hills, golden plains, and beautiful deserts on Texas. He created the great cities known as Houston, San Antonio, Dallas, and Austin. He gave Texas waterways brimming with fish. The people of Texas saw this, and thanked him for it... and then god's [dog walked] onto Texas and took a shit in a spot between Houston and [Corpus Christi]. God grabbed the ol' [Pooper Scooper] and cleaned it up, but the stain remained. This stain would later become known as the town of Victoria, TX.

	(2010-06-08 +67/-240)
	The most boring place to be in Texas. The adults are all conservative [Paultards] and all the kids are on a [sundry] assortment of drugs. This town boasts a large number of both [wangstas] and shit-kickers. There is a street that goes on for at least 3 miles with nothing but churches, because everyone there loves God and hates fags.
	
	Victoria is like a black hole of souls, because once you realize the dull monotony of living here your soul gets sucked into a portal.
	
	The fortunate Victorians either die in drunk driving accidents or leave never to return.
		Example: Yeah man, I got out of Victoria, TX as soon as I can, but I'm now seeking the help of a [therapist] because the shithold completely [annihilated] my sense of [well-being].

Victorian
	(2008-12-08 +138/-66)
	Someone from [the state] of [Victoria] ([Australia])
		Example: Victorians are very [angry people] 
		
		Too much [red meat]? 
		Something in the water? 
		Frustration at always playing [second fiddle] to New South Wales? 
		
		Who knows? 
		Who cares? 
		
		Couldnt really give a fuck one way or the other personally; but, they annoy the crap out of me big-time. 
		
		I have met 3 nice Victorians in my whole life :) 
		
		I have fallen in love with a Victorian; I am such a tool. Seriously, these evil bastards take hate to a whole new level, they enjoy hurting people, it makes them feel more secure. Ive heard the men have skinny cocks which probably pisses the women off, which of course pisses the men off, which unfortunately can also really piss me off if they get too close. 
		
		Did I mention I am a tool? - cool, glad we got that sorted. 
		Already knew all the words of that serene but [harrowing] country song 'Dont fall in love with a Victorian' - check it out sometime its by 'Woolly B & the Sweet pussy collective' - that shit rocks dude!! 
		
		Such a beautiful state too; hell of a fuckin waste to fill Victoria with Victorians. Could have chucked the [Tasmanians] in there; it may have stopped those dirty little [buggers] from inbreeding so bloody much. 
		And quite possibly the Victorians could have gone to Tasmania and inbred themselves into oblivion (the non-existant type of oblivion; not the one that sounds awesome) 
		Too easy, but too fuckin' late to save me ([run to the hills] while you can, you stupid bloody random bogans; the Victorians are coming!!!) 
		
		There is some chance that you may have reached the conclusion that i do not like Victorians.
		Of course, i must admit you are right - well done you, go to the back of the 'big [bus'] and wait for a window to lick 
		
		Ever towed a [caravan] around Australia? 
		Me neither, sounds like a right prick of an idea. 
		Worked in a [Caravan] park once in the sleepy little town of 'Hell on Earth'; the people were all inbred and kinda fucked up 
		Anyway, the point is that in a caravan park you can have a lot of people just sitting around; of course, when a vehicle enters the park they tend to look at the car and its number plates (as you do). 
		If those number plates have 'Victoria' on them - the vibe just goes to shit; its like everyone collectively loses 11 bits of happiness or some other funky fucked up shit 
		
		Victorians are [fucked in the head] 
		Stereotyping is wrong and ridiculously improbable 
		Victorians make their own rules though and because they are fucked; they are fucked! 
		
		Please Victorians stop being angry because you have skinny cocks and are [duck fuckers]. You are pissing the world off. [You are up] your own arse, how can you not feel it? - Fuckin Bogans the lot of you :)

Victorious
	(2013-02-24 +80/-17)
	Victorious is a TV show sequenced in episodes, created by Nickelodeon. The plot is about the comical adventures of Tori, Andre, Kat, Jade, Beck, Trina, and Robbie (and his ventriloquist puppet Rex), who are students at [Hollywood Arts], a high school in California which focuses on theatrical dramas, singing, and acting.
	
	There has been inter-television show contact in previous episodes between the characters of Victorious and iCarly, suggesting that the two stories are based in the same "world".
	
	The audience is focused toward teens and pre-teens. The lead character, Tori Vega, is played by Victoria Justice, a semipopular singer. The producer/director of the show is [Dan Schneider], also the previous director of the show iCarly. He is known for introducing the "PearPad", "[PearPhone]", and overall the "Pear" company as an imitator of the iPad and the iPhone.
		Example: [Random Person] #1: Hey, did you [watch] Victorious last night?
		
		Random Person #2: Yeah, I [loved] it.

	The best [TV show] ever [made]. [PERIODT]!!!

	What you [yell] [when you] [win].
		Example: <after [winning]> [OH]! [VICTORIOUS]!

	(2011-10-16 +290/-170)
	A show on Nick that's pretty funny. People disagree cause they thought this show is another girly show about how they can live their dreams. If they watched the show for more than a minute they might now how good it actually is. This new comedy stars the beautiful and talented Victoria Justice who plays Tori Vega. Who is a girl after doing a performance taking her sister [Trina Vega](Daniella Monet)place in a performance. and has characters like Cat Valentine(Ariana Grande) another beautiful,and talented girl, Jade West(Elizabeth Gillies), Andre Harris(Leon Thomas 3), Robbie Shapiro (Matt Bennett), and [Beck Oliver]([Avan Jogia]).This show is probably the best [Dan Schneider] show created sense Drake and Josh. It deals with actual teen problems unlike the other ones.Icarly is just a show about a webshow, and Zoey 101 witch had Victoria Justice in it was just a boarding school that was treated more as Paris cause all the romance.Beating Drake and Josh would be hard but possible for this show. I give it 5 stars.
		Example: kid 1: you know what may be the best show on Nick sense [Drake and Josh]?-Victorious
		kid 2: I love that show I can't get enough of [Victoria Justice], or [Ariana Grande]

	(2011-01-19 +269/-191)

Unlike iCarly, the acting is actually pretty good, and some of the actors have even been on Broadway, and unlike [Zoey 101], the script is much more realistic, and they have problems other than getting a guy to like them or increasing their popularity.
	
	The show is about a girl named [Tori Vega] who atends a preforming arts school, along with her sister Trina, her friends Andre, Robbie, Cat, Beck, and [Beck's] girlfriend Jade, who at first hated Tori, but then eventually becomes her friend.
	
	Despite the fact that they attend a preforming arts school, as the series progresses, it focuses less on "living their dreams" and more on the character's normal teenage problems. For example, Jade can be occasionally insecure when it comes to Beck hanging out with other girls, like in the episode "Jade Dumps Beck", where Jade breaks up with Beck due to her jealousy of him hanging out with a celebrity named Alyssa Vaughn, or in "Wi-Fi in the Sky", where Jade becomes upset, when she learns that Beck is doing a favor for his [cheerleader next door] neighbor. It is the only show on Nickelodeon currently that deals with real problems of real teens, instead of, "OMG, our webshow doesn't get enough views!" (iCarly) or "I'm a douchebag pop singer who isn't famous enough, whatever will I do?" (Big Time Rush).
		Example: *turns on [Nickelodeon]* "[Dang it], [Big Time Rush] is on, I wanted to watch Victorious!"

	(2010-12-23 +213/-170)
	Victorious is a great Nickelodeon show..
	
	The first episodes center more on Tori (Victoria Justice), a 16-year-old singer who is accepted in a school of arts called [Hollywood Arts] for her talent. There she meets, Beck, ([Avan Jogia]), Andre (Leon Thomas), Cat (Ariana Grande), Jade ([Elizabeth Gillies]) and Robbie (Matt Bennett), the people who become her group of friends later on. The following episodes then focus less on Tori and more on her friends who become main characters too.
	
	Contrary to what another definition has said about Victorious, it is NOT just a typical and boring show about "believing in yourself, becoming famous and fulfilling your dreams‚Äù. Most people who describe Victorious this way didn't even bother to watch past the first or second episode. The show is more about the main character's lives as teenagers than them pursuing their dreams.
	
	I have noticed that many people nowadays hate on all Nick shows that do not have a particularly deep, psychological story full of plot twists (like [As told by Ginger] or Avatar: the last airbender, which are both amazing shows btw, had), but why would a show absolutely have to be like that to be a good show? That is definitely not the type of show [Dan Schneider] (the creator of Victorious) wanted to make, so don‚Äôt expect to see that kind of show. Victorious is a great COMEDY show that should be watched by people who feel like having a good laugh. And these people will have it if they do watch it.
	
	So, watch it!
		Example: Person 1: [I'm bored], i want to watch [something funny]. Any ideas?
		
		Person 2 : Watch Victorious on [Nick]!

This new wave came from Los Angeles and many other troubled cities in Southern CA to the [High Desert].
	
	Cycle 3: 2009-2011
	The current cycle from 2008-2011 consists of the remaining population who found some way to survive in the High Desert who did not lose their home and has some type of good job in the area and also investors and new wealth from outside the area that can afford to live in the [high desert] and take advantage of the property bargains.

Some of the games/systems/accessories are destroyed in a comical manner (flushed down the toilet, stuck in the toaster, etc.) after he is done reviewing them.

They are silent at first glance but very fun once they warm up to you. [Viet's] can have tempers and are not afraid to voice their opinion to someone close to them. However to strangers they remain quiet. Their facial expressions don't necessarily match their emotions. They could be content on the inside yet their face could mean danger. Those named Viet are not necessarily the brightest [crayon] [in the box], however they will do anything to make their loved ones happy. Don't [misuse] their trust or let them down, because they can easily fall down the wrong path. If they've wronged you in some way, they will do all it takes to [redeem] themselves.

Viet Cong
	(2012-09-08 +423/-70)
	The Communist-led [guerrilla] force and [revolutionary] army of South [Vietnam].
		Example: The Viet Cong had their first victory of the Vietnam War at the Battle of Ap [Bac] in January [1963], which was followed by the overthrow of [Ngo Dinh Diem] and an increasingly less stable South Vietnam.

	(2011-06-19 +172/-44)
	The Communist-led forces fighting the South Vietnamese government. The political wing was known as the National Liberation Front, and the military was called the People's Liberation Armed Forces. Both the [NLF] and the [PLAF] were directed by the People's Revolutionary Party ([PRP]), the southern branch of the Vietnamese Communist Party, which received direction from [Hanoi] through COSVN, which was located in III Corps on the Cambodian border. After 1968, as negotiations began in Paris, the NLF established the [Provisional] Revolutionary Government.
		Example: The Viet Cong were organized into three levels: regular forces operating under the command of the southern communist leadership, full time guerrillas organized into companies serving under [provincial] leadership and finally, a [part time] self-defense [militia], composed of units organized into squads and platoons used primarily for village defense.

	(2010-07-24 +100/-27)
	(VIETNAM HISTORY) term coined by the authorities in South Vietnam to refer to the patriotic [insurgency] against the [Saigon] regime. The term has been traced to the head of [Ngo Dinh Diem's] secret police, although at this time (1960) the insurgents were not always Communist. The correct term is "National Liberation Front" ([NLF]).
	
	"[Cong]" is used to mimic the term "Com," for "Communist." The Vietnamese language does not really allow speakers to pronounce "Com."
	
	The National Liberation Front was originally an association of many organizations, including religious organizations. The leader, Hua Tho, was not a Marxist at all. However, the [Diem] administration organized the physical extermination of all opposition, including peaceful opposition, so the result was that only underground guerrilla movements could actually engage in politics. Naturally, the survival of the NLF depended on its ability to fight the Saigon regime, which meant rural insurgency, which meant gradual integration into the [PAVN] command structure.
	
	The NLF grew quite strong; by 1968, it was able to carry out crucial operations in the [Tet Offensive]. Unfortunately, it was almost eradicated by the US military in the offensive, and had to be recreated.
		Example: The most popular aspect of the National Liberation Front program was the promise to take the land from the rich and to distribute it to the peasants.
		
		After [Diem] had gained power in South Vietnam, he reversed [Viet Minh] land reforms, causing his regime to be [bitterly] hated by most peasants. So they joined the Viet Cong.

	(2013-01-19 +13/-9)
	[Rural] [outlaws] whom [creep around] at night to commit their evil crimes
		Example: "Better keep your dogs inside [at night], ['cause] the Viet Cong have been [stealing] them lately."

	(2005-04-10 +93/-92)
	a person, belongeing to the National [Liberation] Front, fighting against the [monarchy] and [capitalist] American interests.
		Example: The bourgeois government of America was sending it brainwashed and exploited [proletariat] to aid fascist [monarchy] in Vietnam against the [viet-cong]

	(2008-01-14 +52/-116)
	The [Viet-Cong] were cowardly soldiers fighting America, Australia, South Korea and Canada among other white nations. The Viet-Cong fought on behalf of international communism and were financed and equipped by the giant commie powers of USSR and China. They fought in a cowardly manner in that while we all wore military uniforms but they pretended to be ordinary citizens of the RVN during the day, but they would go out at night or whenever they had a chance to try to kill us using cowardly methods such as concealed [land mines] on trails we would be likely to use, and setting grenades to go off with trip wires, and concealing sharpened [punji] sticks covered with their own shit to cause foot injuries in the feet of the [GI's]. For a time, before we blocked them, they used little kids to drop grenades into the gas tanks of GI vehicles. The grenade had [the pin] pulled with the triggering lever held down only by a rubber band.
	Despite all their backing and their treacherous butchery, the Viet-Cong were so thoroughly dominated by our forces that they had to sign off in 1973 on the Paris [Peace Treaty] as the only way to get us out of there. After that they proved their [treachery] once again so that as soon as all of us GI's were gone in reliance on the 1973 treaty, also signed by "North Vietnam", they re-invaded the south in 1975 with massive military power provided to them again by international communist assholes.Too bad for them all that communism was subsequently shown to be a demonic failure as a governmental system.
	My favorite [double-time] chant yelled in time with the footsteps at Basic Combat Training is:
	IM GOING TO GO [TO VIETNAM]
	IM GOING TO KILL THE [VIET-CONG]
		Example: Bob: Let's travel over [to Vietnam] to check out the places we were stationed.
		Phil: I'm will never go to visit a bunch of treaty-breaking communist elites. Don't you know that members of the Viet-Cong are still there pretending to be high government officials? They only time I'm going to go there again is with a military invasion force to invade them from [Saigon] to [Hanoi]. All they deserve is total invasion because of their 1973 treaty violation and to free the people of Vietnam who are again suffering under tyrannical communism.

Viet Minh
	(2011-06-21 +131/-16)
	The Viet Minh, or League for the independence of Vietnam, was a nationalist organization that was created during World War II. It was an underground army established by [Ho Chi Minh] fighting against foreign occupation by using [guerrilla warfare]. The Viet Minh de-emphasized the communist social revolution to attract broadest possible coalitions. After Germany had conquered France, [German's] ally, the Japanese, moved into Vietnam. Japan did not have enough resources to rule over Vietnam as France had. The lack of control over the Vietnamese led to the formation of many nationalist organizations. The most effective being the Viet Minh.
		Example: In 1960, the National Liberation Front ([NLF]) was founded by the main members of the Viet Minh. The NLF operated in South Vietnam and swore to overthrow the South Vietnamese government in order to reunify Vietnam. The Viet Minh began to fade as their members began to join the NLF. During the French Indochina War (1946‚Äì1954), the [VPA] (Vietnam People's Army) was often referred to as the Viet Minh. In the context of the Vietnam War ([1959]‚Äì1975), the army was referred to as the North Vietnamese Army ([NVA]) or [the People's] Army of Vietnam ([PAVN]). This allowed the U.S. Military, and the general public, to distinguish northern communists from the southern communists, or [Viet Cong]. However, northerners and southerners were always under the same command structure.

	(2012-09-08 +351/-96)
	A member of the Vietnamese political and military movement led by [Ho Chi Minh] that [challenged] the Japanese and defeated the French between [1941] and 1954.
		Example: When the Japanese surrendered to the Allies, the Communist Viet Minh, led by [Ho Chi Minh], reasserted independence as a [democratic republic]. The French moved in [militarily] to try to reclaim the nation, ultimately supporting the government of Bao Dai along with the United States and Britain. The Chinese began supplying Ho Chi Minh with weapons, and fighting in the country continued through the 1950s.

vietnam
	(2005-03-19 +562/-137)
	A beautiful country with a rich culture and history dating back over 3,000 years.  A former French colony, along with Cambodia and [Laos], from the late 1800s to the early 1950s; as such, [Vietnam's] two largest cities, the capital [Hanoi] and the financial center [Ho Chi Minh] City (aka [Saigon]), share the title of "Paris of Southeast Asia" and have many buildings and monuments of French design.  However, the cultural heart and soul of Vietnam is undoubtedly the ancient imperial capital of Hue, with its beautiful palaces, mausoleums, parks and canals.
	
	In 1995, more than twenty years after the end of a tragic and horrible war with the United States that scarred both countries deeply ‚Äî one physically and the other psychologically ‚Äî relations with the US have been normalized; contrary to popular belief in the States, most Vietnamese are very friendly and hold no [animosity] towards Americans, who now vacation in Vietnam in great numbers.
		Example: It's a [country], [not a] [war].

	(2004-11-20 +782/-231)
	A country in Southeast Asia that has gone through enourmous Imperial and Colonial rule. As well as lots of wars to be it's own country.
	
	China controlled the country for over 1000 years, and Vietnam revolted. France, and Japan during WWII, than controlled it 1887-1954, the French were cruel to the Vietnamese people and forced many of them into rubber plantations. France lost it's control by the [Viet Minh], a communist group who wanted to free their country of [France's] rule. After France's lost of control, the country [splitted] into two different Countries, North and South. North Vietnam was a [Communist Country] lead by the [Viet Cong], formaly the Viet Minh, who's leader was Ho Chi Minh. South Vietnam was a democratic/republic country with their leader as [Ngo Dinh Diem] with heavy support from the US. Ngo Dihn [Diem] was a Roman Catholic, while the majority of the people were Buddhist, he was a really corrupt leader who was chosen by the US.
	
	Under a treaty, The North and South were to have an election on reforming their country into a [Communist country] or a Democratic/Republic Country with help from the US. The people would of chosen Communism, because Communism freed Vietnam from the French and the people wanted to be their own country without the help of the US. The US, not wanting communism, told Ngo Dinh Diem to not hold the election. This angered the North Vietnamese government who wanted to reunite their country and wanted to rule their own country without help. The US sent troops into Vietnam to make sure it didn't become a Communist Country. This is the reason of the Vietnam War.
	
	The North Vietnamese Army were determined to make their country a country where their people would rule, and they succeeded with the withdrawal of the US.
	
	Vietnam is now a "socialist republic" country who's primary language is Vietnamese, and their second languages are English, French, and Chinese. They have forgiven their enemies in exchange for peace and to make their country a great country, who's past is full of Imperialist and [Colonialist] rule.

	(2006-12-12 +28/-116)
	The word "[To Vietnam]", a transitive verb, is used to describe a specie of treacherous conduct used by a weak and beggarly foe to defeat a stronger and more righteous foe. The Republic of Vietnam was a party, with the US, to the [SEATO] [treaty] which said that if any party outside the treaty attacked any member, that the other treaty members would help the attacked member. The US was therefore bound by duty and honor to enter the war upon the invasion of the south by the north. North Vietnam intended to and tried hard to impose a [communistic] form of government on the south by military force. North Vietnam was the point soldier in a proxy effort by communism aparatchicks to rule the entire world, but they could get any traction at all while American solders like me were there. In 1973 the [commies] "[Vietnamed]" or tricked the USA into leaving RVN. The commies promised that if we left Vietnam they would never again invade the south with military force. We left in 1973 and by 1975 the commies were openly breaking the Paris treaty.

Vietnam Syndrome
	(2007-03-02 +82/-37)
	A view held largely by American conservatives that the "loss" of the Vietnam War has created an American public biased against any type of [American military] conflict.
	
	They argue that bad memories of the Vietnam War (scandals, protests, riots, images of killed/[wounded soldiers] and civilians, etc.) have caused the American people to [distrust] any type of war at all.  As a result, it is argued, any attempt by the United States to engage in a military conflict will be viewed by the American people as "another Vietnam."
	
	President George [H.W]. Bush declared Vietnam Syndrome "kicked" after the relatively successful end of the Gulf War.
	
	There is considerable debate as to whether the War in Iraq is "another Vietnam" and the use of that phrase has caused many to believe that Vietnam Syndrome is alive and well.
	
	"Vietnam Syndrome" is NOT to be confused with PTSD or re-adjustment problems experienced by some Vietnam veterans.

	Vietnam is now a "socialist republic" country who's primary language is Vietnamese, and their second languages are English, French, and Chinese. They have forgiven their enemies in exchange for peace and to make their country a great country, who's past is full of Imperialist and [Colonialist] rule.
		Example: Marine: "Damn [Viet Cong]! We're just [here to help] you damn Communist!"
		
		Viet Cong: "If America never ever stopped that election, I would be at home in [VIETNAM], and you would be at home!"

Vietnam War
	(2011-08-06 +326/-51)
	A drinking game based on the war of the same name. Similar to beer pong.
	
	Two teams, America and [Vietnam], both get 10 [cups]. America arranges their cups in a triangle (as in beer pong), with the usual amount of beer in them. Vietnam places their cups anywhere they like on their side of the table, but the cups are full.
	
	If America makes a shot, someone on team Vietnam has to drink the whole cup and removes it. If Vietnam makes a shot, someone on [team America] has to drink the cup and [refill] it.
	
	The game ends when all cups on the Vietnam side are gone, or when America gives up.
		Example: Hey, [wanna play] [beer pong]?" "[Nah], I got a better game, it's called the Vietnam War."

	(2010-02-09 +255/-49)
	Why Did the USA invade Vietnam?
	After the second world war, The USA and The USSR emerged as the world's two great superpowers. However, the two nation's political systems conflicted and a war of words and threat broke out. This was known as the cold war. America became increasingly fearful of [the Soviet Union's] communist system spreading across the world, one country at a time. This theory was known as the 'domino theory'. When China went communist in 1949, America felt that the threat of communism was very real. As a result, they entered Korea and were partially successful; The ROK (South Korea) remains a capitalist state today. They then turned their attentions too Vietnam, where a communist group known as the [Viet Minh] had emerged, founded by [Ho Chi Minh]. France were already present in Vietnam as it had been a colony of their's prior to WW2. However, even after a vast amount of support given by the USA, the French were eventually driven out by the Viet Minh. America's response to this was to help [Ngo Dinh Diem] to power in south Vietnam. [Diem] was a [ruthless dictator] who was cruel to the peasant population of Vietnam, but he was anti-communist, and so the USA helped him. Before long, a new communist militia group was set up called the Viet Cong, again founded by Ho Chi Minh. America began to send military 'advisers' to combat the Viet Cong. This continued for a few year until eventually, in 1965, The USA was fully at war with communist forces in Vietnam.
		Example: The Vietnam War was a 'product' of [the cold war].

	(2005-05-19 +558/-130)
	The most [controversial] [war in] [History].
		Example: [My Dad] was [involved] in the Vietnam War

	(2012-01-31 +76/-44)
	The only war the United States has ever lost. After WW2 and the rise of the USSR, North Vietnam became a communist region. The US was afraid that if South Vietnam fell to communism, other small countries would also become communist. At first they sent advisors to the [South's] army but they needed extra support so US troops were sent. It was a [war of attrition], victories were won not by total area gained but by body count. It was a very nasty war, with a lot of hatred by the American public. Over 50,000 american soldiers died, as opposed to the 2 million North Vietnamese killed. A lot of American pilots were shot down and captured as POWs and sent to camps, such as the famous "[Hanoi Hilton]" that became a symbol of the barbaric Vietcong. Contrary to popular belief, the US never lost a battle in Vietnam. Nixon decided to pull out due to the negative opinion of the war and to secure his reelection calling it "Peace with honor". The State Dept lost the war folks, not the military.
		Example: My [ROTC] instructor was a [Huey] [pilot] in the Vietnam War.

	(2005-08-03 +592/-515)
	A war where America [stuck it's] nose where it shouldn't of and subsequently got chased out of the country like crying little schoolgirls.
	
	Also the Americans slaughtered countless innocent [women and children] under the belief that they were [spies] and conspirators.
		Example: America was [defeated] by a country with less than [1/10] of their military, population and economic [capacity].

	(2011-06-16 +159/-144)
	A war that the State Department lost, not the [U.S. military]. Dumbass [liberal college] students and hippies trying to turn our country into a communist [regime] at the same time didn't help, either.
		Example: After I got back from the Vietnam War, some hippie [spit on] my uniform and called me a baby-killing [war criminal], so I broke his jaw, just to remind him that it's because of "baby-killers" like me that he has the freedom to express his thoughts, no matter how wrong or [asinine] those thoughts are.

	(2006-12-12 +162/-182)
	A war which [America] [chose] [to lose].
		Example: We had the [upperhand] in the Vietnam War until we [pulled out] due to the massive [anti-war] movement in the United States.

	(2005-05-26 +64/-76)
	Well, ill start with the [Domino Theory]. I said that when south vietnam would be conquered, the communism would spread. this was the basis of fighting the war.
	I dont feel like going through all of the statistics and stuff, but we basically won [militarily]. The vietcong was practically annihilated. The North Vietnamese army was crippled. Our estimations of enemy death tolls (the media said were too high) were actually too low. we killed many more.
	Effects of war: basically a "warning" so that the [domino effect] would not occur we may have not turned it around, but we sure as hell stopped it.
		Example: the vietnam war was fairly simple, and would have been easily a stunning victory if it had been continued for [five more minutes]. it was so successful anyway, thanks to G. Warren [Nutter], Assistant Secretary of War of foreign affairs. he basically ran the war. --also my grandpa
		
		communism before war--
		after--
		--- why it seems we lost but....
		communism if we didnt fight, the year the war did end -----
		--- if we kept fighting -
		
		if you dont get that [diagram], dont try to figure it out. its kinda pointless.

	(2005-10-10 +127/-166)
	A war in which ignorant hippies in the USA as well as the usual ignorant foreigners and communist supporters around the world helped lower the morale of the brave soldiers who were fighting in Vietnam against communists and called them [baby killers] among other things when the soldiers who were over there had seen and gone through more than any one of those cowards would ever see in their pathetic lives.  And then after the communist supporters got their way the North Vietnamese as well as [Pol Pot] and the Cambodian communists went on to kill 3 million people in both countries (including many women and children that the cowards dispised the American soldiers for supposedly killing earlier in the war) the rest of which were put into [slave labor] camps in Cambodia.  Of course the communist supporters ignored the genocide after the war because of their cowardice and ignorance.
		Example: Most [hippies] and [communist] compare the Vietnam War with the [War on Terrorism].  It looks like they are still just as ignorant now as they were 30 years ago.

Vietnamese
	(2010-06-26 +1406/-288)
	I, a Vietnamese person, see a lot of this conceited things as well as things that just aren't true at all. Everyone who's writing the hate stuff about Vietnamese people are just...[wtf man]. I saw a person that wrote how we just rip off from Chinese, Korean, Japanese, all that stuff. Well you know what? We barely have ANYTHING that the Japanese have, in Vietnam we learn to how to do many useful things in life at a young age that many Americans can't. Chinese? They freaking ruled over us for many years so our words derived from them. Our writing style derived from French. Korean? You're just naming another country. Most of us are hardworking. You know why? Because most of our parents come from Vietnam [coming to America] with nearly nothing but their clothes and a few cents of change. There's a few people who don't want to work hard because they're not caring or live in a bad environment, but most of us do. We do not say "[du ma]" every few seconds, but Americans always ask us how to say "[eff you]" in Vietnamese, so don't blame us. No we don't all do nails, or all computer engineers, or all doctors and stuff. Yes, we have contributed to modern day. One of the most recent ones is the "[mind control] wheelchair" for those who are completely [paralyzed] on their whole body. We aren't all short, or have [squeeky] voices, or have tiny eyes.
		Example: Stereotypes aren't real. If ALL Vietnamese (Asians in general) were small, [squeeky] voiced, only drive Hondas and Toyotas, eat dog, are Buddhist and have [small eyes], then black people all love fried chicken, watermelon, listen to rap, basketball, giant eyes, love purple drank, driving in Cadilacs, and be over [6 feet tall]. All white people would be listening to country, hunting, eating deer, and driving trucks.

Vietnamese are so [united] and wonderful that could beat a lot of powerful countries in the war, including China, America, [Mongolia], Japan.

In CONCLUSION, I would just like to say FUCK ALL YOU SHITBRICKS and RACIST MOTHAFUCKERS who started this SHIT in the first place. THANK YOU AND HAVE A [SHITTY DAY]!

They are the majority ethnic group of Vietnam, comprising 86% of the population as of the 1999 [census], and are officially known as [Kinh] to distinguish them from other ethnic groups in Vietnam.
	
	Vietnamese are not to be confused with yeet nam wah kews.
	
	It would be interesting to note that only one-third (or 33%) of Viets actually marry Viets. Most Vietnamese marry Southern Chinese (Cantonese) or Whites. This is due to the fact that Viets had to go through alot and the country has enough Chinese and Whites in it.

	2)short for "[vigorish]" used in gambling;When wagering on a straight wager ([point spread] or total), you lay a certain amount of money to win a smaller amount of money. The difference between what is wagered and what is won is called the 'Juice' or 'VIG'. This 'Juice' or 'VIG' is one of the ways a sports book makes its money. In football and basketball the 'Juice' (or 'VIG') is 10%. In other words, for every $110 wagered you will win $100. If you lose the wager, you lose $110. If you win the wager, you get the $110 'Juice' refunded to you, plus the $100 in winnings ($110 + $100 = $210 total paid back to your account).
		Example: 1)joe, "Lucky Hands wants one over prime".
		tony, "what?".

	The interest to a [loan] on the street or through a [bookie]. It is common to not [pay back] the principle but have to pay the "[vig]" or interest weekly to keep your legs intact.

This is why [loans] are given freely on the streets, as most people borrowing could most likely pay back the entire loan, but can usually come up with the vig every week. This also lets loan sharks get their "hooks into you" if you borrow this money, as you will probably be paying it far longer than expected and after you finally pay off the principle with the vig, you will have often paid more then double or triple of the total borrowed.

	(2011-09-21 +103/-13)
	(1491-1547) A King of England who began as a handsome, sweet-natured prince and became a fat, bloated, lecherous, ruthless, narcissistic tyrant whose split from the Catholic faith to divorce his first wife and marry his second can be felt today.
	He married six times, first to [Katherine of Aragon] (divorced), then to Anne Boleyn (beheaded), then to Jane Seymour (died), then to [Anne of Cleves] (divorced), then to [Katherine Howard] (beheaded), and finally to Katherine Parr (survived).
	To his credit, he legitimized the crown after decades of the War of the Roses (warring between the two branches of the royal family), but he is remembered today for his lechery and for abusing his wives and his two daughters in a futile effort for a healthy son; only his daughter Elizabeth I would be his saving grace.
		Example: After the death of Jane Seymour from childbirth, a new wife was sought for Henry VIII, reaching across Europe, but his reputation preceded him; he chose 16-year-old Christina of Milan first, but the widowed duchess (a [great-niece] of [Katherine of Aragon]) refused, saying that she would be happy to marry him if she had two heads. Henry next chose Marie de Guise, another young widow, since "as a big man he needed a big wife"; she rejected his offer and quipped that she may have been a big woman but she had a very little neck (in reference to Anne Boleyn) and she wasted little time in marrying Henry's nephew, James V of Scotland. [Anne of Cleves] became the first pick as other candidates made excuses or married.
		Henry VIII seemed to have a liking for redheads named Katherine, since he married three such women.
		
		Messenger: (to a group of young noblewomen) "His Royal Majesty Henry VIII seeketh another wife."
		Young noblewomen: (screaming in horror and stampeding)

	(2009-05-16 +39/-10)
	Henry VIII was a king of England in the 16th century and head of the Church of England. He had 6 wives: [Katherine of Aragon], Anne Boleyn, Jane Seymour, [Anne of Cleves], Kathryn Howard, and [Catherine Parr].
	He called Jane Seymour his "true wife" because she was the only one to give him a son (Edward VI)
	Anne Boleyn and Kathryn Howard were beheaded for treason
	Katherine of Aragon and Anne of Cleves were divorced.
	Catherine Parr was widowed and went on to marry Thomas Seymour.

	1. n. The practice of sending your non-functional electronics to the afterlife.

	1.) place dead electronics in a boat
	2.) set the boat on fire 
	3.) let it drift out on a body of water. 
	
	    The higher the esteem for your dead device, the more [peripherals] and accessories you include [in the boat] so that it may have the same status, functionality, esteem and quality of life in the afterlife.  Besides, manufacturers usually don't make the same connectors on different devices.

		Example: 1) When I stopped drooling into my Mac Airbook, I realized it would no longer work.  Since I love my Mac so much, I went to a near by lake to give it a [Viking funeral].

	(2009-07-10 +75/-25)
	A subgenre of death metal with strong roots in Scandinavian countries such as Norway and Finland. It is similar to folk metal in the aspect that it heavily utilizes melody combined with instruments such as the accordion, [panflute] and harp, along with deep operatic backing vocals to achieve a medieval atmosphere. Lyrical content deals with Viking culture and a Norse outlook - the belief that the only way to gain passage into Valhalla in Asgard is to die in a grand battle or adventure. It also shares subject matter with power metal, in that it deals with legend-esque things like warriors and dragons. Adversely it can be seen as [power metal's] opposite, as power metal deals with knights and heroes using [neo-classical] undertones where the protagonists of [viking metal] are swarthy and violent, almost barbaric.
	Though viking metal is dark and grave in nature much like black metal, artists and fans of this genre tend to have a positive outlook - unlike screamo and gothicism, it's not themselves they hate, but everyone else.
		Example: Some good [viking metal] and [folk metal] bands include [Ensiferum], Bathory, Amon Amarth, Folkearth and Finntroll.

	Generally, all the girls at [villa] are huge [beersluts] and have nothing better to do with their lives than spend it completely fucked up with their mouth on [some guy's] dick e.g every senior at that school.  It's pretty sad that you guys consider yourselves outstanding and different in a good way, because everybody just likes to get u fucked up and take advantage of you.  Have fun wasting your life and carrying around those STDs.
		Example: "[what are we] going to do tonight?"
		"[get fucked] up and [hook up with] dudes.  that's what we always do."
		"i mean in addition to that."
		"is there anything else to do?"

	Wow.....I can't actually believe that people from [Villa] and [Notre Dame] have actually [stooped] so low as to smash each other on some stupid web site. I go to Notre Dame, but I have a lot of friends from Villa too, and I can say that some of my best friends go to Villa. Get over it.  Just because one school has more merit finalists or is better at [field hockey] it doesn't mean that one is suddenly soooo much better than the other and everyone should post bitchy comments about each other....because if you look at it, your insults towards each other are exactly the same and therefore you're not exactly being classier or more original than each other by posting them. And just because we're known as the "Notre Dykes", it does not mean that we are lesbians or have a lesbian alumnae club, just as you aren't all fat and ugly just because your equally moronic nickname are [the Villa] Gorillas.
		Example: Wow, we all sure do have class for [bashing] [each other] on [urbandictionary.com]!

	(2005-03-20 +41/-19)
	These insults are so good. Talking about whos better in school? Wow. This [feeble] attempt is more [amusing] then watching [Devon] kids try play contact sports
		Example: 'my [school] is [better than] yours because our [grades] are higher'

	(2005-03-19 +59/-36)
	You girls are rediculous. These definitions are rediculous. I graduated from [The Academy of Notre Dame] but was also a [Villa Maria] student at one point in time. I obviously enjoyed [the Notre Dame] community WAY more than Villa and yes I'll side with ND first over everything, but in all seriousness..don't post some stupid definition busting on Notre Dame. Last time I checked these are supposed to define "Villa Maria Girls" not Notre Dame. You wanna know what a Villa girl is...She's a private all-girls schoolgirl who is just like the rest of us. We all wear north face, popped collars, pearls, and ribbons. I have friends from Villa and they're great. All the little assholes posting this shit "villa vs. nd (or whoever else)" are obviously very young because when it comes down to it...a lot of us are actually friends. We've grown together and partied together. So underclassmen: get over your bullshit.
		Example: [ND girl]: We're getting a keg you guys wanna go in on it with us?
		[Villa] girl: We'll be over [in ten] minutes.

	Generally known as the best Catholic all-girls school on the Main Line. Commonly compared to the [Academy of Notre Dame] yet exceeds them annually in both the number of national merit semifinalists and finalists, and the field hockey seasons. In fact, Notre Dame has had to switch leagues in many sports due to their decline of sportsmanship and competency. [Villa] Girls are generally more well-rounded and better. The typical Villa girl parades to classes each day in her cute knee socks, uniform, LL Bean or North Face school bag, and a hair ribbon that gets cuter and cuter each day of the year. She generally is involved in one or more school sport, three clubs at the very least (Villa sports a mean list of clubs, everything from service, public relations, yoga and SADD becuase Villa girls never make destructive decisions!), and a challenging selection of courses each year. They are extremely well prepared for the great colleges they are accepted into. Villa is prestiged in athletics, academics, and the arts. Villa girls are very personable, fun young ladies. They sure know how to have a good time! That's why they are in very high demand with boys from [Malvern Prep], [Devon Prep], [St. Joes] Prep, [the Haverford School], EA, and various surrounding institutions. Many a Malvern or [Prep boy] has commented that while Notre Dykes or 'Hos of the Hill are fun "flings" and "hookups," Villa girls make great serious girlfriends. Their outstanding character leaves little room for question when it comes to committing. Villa girls are born with a natural beauty and sense of class, and unlike [Notre Dame girls], their excellent sense of style comes naturally, not from their friends' older sisters. On the weekends the girls can be seen sporting preppy-boho styles, with a proper balance of Abercrombie&Fitch with [BCBG] Max Azaria, and select vintage items. A Villa girl's staples include Lacostes, Vera Bradley, and [DuWop's] [Lip Venom]. Along with her great school and excellent style, Villa girls know how to have fun! They attend and host their share of excellent parties on the weekend, usually for a select group of Villa girls and Malvern boys (we wouldn't want them to be spoiled by any disruptive Notre Dykes.)While Villa girls aren't all perfect, their worst traits are usually just their dirty language. With their perfectly groomed hair, extremely fit bodies, radiant smiles, and glowing countenances, Villa girls are the best around!
		Example: "[Muffy], will you look at that! [Villa] beat out Notre Dame again! I bet you Bob asks a Villa Girl to prom instead of that [Notre Dyke] neighbor of ours..."

	(2005-03-19 +33/-28)
	Alright I go to [Villa], and these "insults" are pretty lame and [definately] [disappointing]. If you're gonna insult us, at least do it right
		Example: Oh yes, of course I ALWAYS wear my shirts the size of [bras] in the winter time. They're just FABULOUS for [rolling around] [the snow] in!!

	(2005-03-22 +15/-12)
	Hey "[nice try]".. maybe you should also learn to [spell] before [insulting] other bad spellers.
		Example: In order to graduate [grammar school], one must recognize that grammar is spelled with an "[ar]" rather than an "er". That's just a little something I learned before I was accepted to [Notre Dame]. Honestly, does anyone have anything else to say?

	(2007-10-20 +16/-14)
	[Villa Maria girls], they often portray the stature of man or gorilla. While other teams compete against them in sports, sometimes we ask ourselves how much testosterone is enough? There manly bodies overwhelm any set amount of space. When they enter the room, they get everyones attention...in a bad way. Girls it is not attractive to see tight clothes squeezing your flub. Next time wear spandex to cover your cottage cheese ass. The only times you get laid is by a man, woman dog or inanimate ojects suffering from a severe mental [illnes] and/or blindess. [Notre Dame girls] dont hate you, they just feel bad for you. Its not their fault your not attractive.  Notre Dame girls on the other hand represent beauty and goddess-like figures. They party twice as hard as villa girls and dont get those ugly beer bellies that you all sport. Notre Dame girls have tried to be nice to Villa girls.... but its not their fault the gorillas have ruined every chance they have with anyone who is considered "normal" So to sum up every ones beliefs.... Notre Dame rocks... villa? not so much.
		Example: "i heard about [this one time] these [villa maria girls] were trying to give it to some guys...."
		
		"yeah they fucking [crushed] him"

	(2005-03-21 +24/-24)
	Dear Students from [VMA] and [NDA],
	[Get over] yourselves.
		Example: I go to the [Academy of Notre Dame] and apparently I'm one of the few students there who realize what "class" is.  And hey [Villa] girls, if you knew what it was, there wouldn't be an [effing] battle on urbandictionary.com.

	also commonly known as "[Villa] Gorillas" because of their large size. [Villa Maria] is a small catholic private school where girls go when they do not make it into Notre Dame. Most are beat but obsessed with themselves and will post pictures of their own boobs on their [webshots]. They are typically very overrated because guys mistake their eassiness for hottness. They go to parties in the winter and sport shirts the size of bras and think they look hott, but dont realize that everyone is really staring at their fat. They are bitter that they cant be hott or classly and therefore try to make up for it by being slutty. They date [Malvern] guys, but only the ugly ones that are left over after Notre Dame gets the hott ones.
		Example: "wow look at that [slut's] thighs!"
		"shes a [villa] [gorilla]"

	Oh yea [notre dame],i've seen your classy-ness you speak of. My favorite was when at a party one of you stuck a beer bottle, basically [up yourself] because the guy you were with wasen't as you put it "pleasuring you enough" wow, thats class.  And don't confuse that girls go to villa cause they didn't get into notre dame, i got in to your school in 6th grade, and got a huge scholarship 9th grade, and didn't go either times.  And someone post the name of one hot [malvern] guy you have, go for it.

Also if Notre Dame is such a bad school, [please explain] the large number of girls that leave villa to go to notre dame.  And if u beat ND in any sports, it is clearly because u are all huge beasts.

	A small city known as "The Hidden Jewel" where its half rich old people and other half [new money] with kids who have to drive beemers or mercedes. People think it has mexicans because of all of them that travel from orange for school, buts thats false. The city is more than 85% white people. Also one of the most conservative and wealthiest places in orange county. Full of mansions and big houses with huge lots. Much better than [south county] because you get a nice area close to a real cities like [Anaheim], instead of everything being cookie cutter like [RSM] or Irvine. Only 20 minutes from the beach off the 55 freeway its easy to get to Villa Park, just no one knows its there because its "The Hidden Jewel" of Orange County.

Villa Walsh Academy (New Jersey)
	(2010-11-21 +64/-14)
	[Villa Walsh Academy]. where the definition of a badass is someone who takes the elevetor without an elevator pass, and a slut is someone who rolls their skirt so it shows their knees and their knee socks don't cover their whole shin. Where excitement is finding a dollar, which will be spent on a bottom shelf cookie. Where there are 3 types of people: the crazy [overachievers] who are completely obsessed with villa walsh (true villa gorillas), the people whose parents forced them to go and are trying to make the best of it and failing miserably, and the ones who are barely getting by and screw the world. Where nuns roam the halls, and when the headmaster goes down the halls girls quickly unroll their skirts and tuck in their blouses. Where "facilitate" "corridor" and "student responsibilities" are used 300 times per morning announcement. Oh [villa walsh academy].
		Example: [Villa Walsh Academy] ([New Jersey])

Villa Walsh Academy (VWA)
	(2005-05-23 +276/-104)
	It's not 4 years... It's 4 life.
	An all-girls Catholic school located in [Morristown], NJ which features old and decaying nuns monitoring the halls. It is a place where ankles are scandalous and too many [untucked] shirts are grounds for expulsion. It is a place where they love to sing, and will use almost any excuse to burst into harmonic hymns. The lowest GPA for a class of 50 will be a 3.2, and the senior class will spontaneously erupt into fistfights to see who gets to attend BC, Notre Dame, and Georgetown. Losers will go to Loyola, [Villanova], or Fairfield. Lunch costs $8, and consists of 8 oz. of "gourmet" mac and cheese. Breadsticks, due to increasing thefts, are an extra $2. This school also features a "[penthouse suite]" - previously nuns' chambers, these prestigiously located rooms are the current homes for the two most legendary and enlightened teachers at the school and their playful seeing-eye pooch, Pam (shout out to [Reba]). The grounds are extensive and beautiful, whether viewed from the bridge full of cacti or from wandering around outside. The school features a [gazebo] where you can sit but not eat, a funeral [pyre] placed before the tower (enacting pretend human sacrifices on this is frowned upon), and a statue of Mary that looks suspisciously like Jesus. Students who act up are punished by being made to run from the man-statue of Mary up the hill to the funeral pyre.
	Often associated with [Delbarton], other than sharing a bus to and from school, there is little association. Probably because everyone's too tired from having to walk up and down petruvious amounts of stairs all day long. Huge amounts of oddly shaped and spaced stairs.
	[A word to the wise]: Don't kick a bible down the locker room. They don't like that either, and you will be [smote].
		Example: Where [can you] find flame-retardant plaids [aplenty]?
		[Villa Walsh Academy].

	(2005-02-23 +186/-91)
	A small, all-girls Catholic school located in [Morristown], NJ.  Its student population is very [homogenous], mostly white and Catholic, and the girls are competitive, athletic, intelligent and preppy. The school is run by nuns, and the adjoining convent serves as the national headquarters for the Religious Teachers Filippini. Known for its emphasis on academics, especially math and science, uniform infractions, spring musical, abundance of singers, and its ugly white sweaters for chapel.  It is the sister-school of [Delbarton].
		Example: Oh, [you go] to VWA?  You must be a [Villa] [Gorilla].

	(2005-11-05 +48/-90)
	A school that every student loves to hate. Home to only two types of students: the insane [overachievers] who've never had a boyfriend and the slacker potheads who screw everyone in the county.
	
	Class periods are either spent frantically taking notes or sleeping, depending on which category of student you fall into. The cool teachers enjoy messing with students' heads and the stupid teachers just try to keep classes under control. However, that is impossible. For every class there are roughly two troublemakers who can ruin any teacher's day and make any student's. These students never try but get good grades anyway.
	
	Spirit days are the joy of every [villa] girl's existence, it gives them an excuse to look even stranger than they normally do. 
	
	Lunch periods are spent throwing things at each other or daring each other to eat whatever girls can put together. Sometimes a combination of the two ensues and the principal has to lecture the entire school on proper lunchroom [etiquitte]. 
	
	Another interesting fact of [Villa] life that nobody has mentioned yet are the masses. These are spent trying to see who can say [the f word] the most times without anyone looking over. Sometimes [nuns] see girls laughing at each other and  give them The Holy Look of Death. These nuns are just angry because the girls got more action last weekend then they did in their whole [nunly] celibate lives. [Nuns] suck.
	
	After school, students go to their various dorky clubs and [take the bus] over to [delbarton]. These bus trips are spent putting on makeup and hanging out the window, screaming their numbers at the athletic field. However, since they are Villa Gorillas, no one will ever call them. Ever. 
	
	Besides, [Delbarton] boys are all gay. 
		Example: [Villa Walsh Academy] (VWA)- the biggest waste of [tuition] in the [morristown] area.

	(2005-04-30 +112/-260)
	An all-girls school with ugly [wannabes] who think that they are [Delbarton's] sister school when in all reality, all the [Delbarton] guys hate them.
		Example: gorilla: [heyyyy] you're from [delbarton].. you must like us [villa] girls
		
		delbarton: *laughs and walks away*

	(2005-04-30 +94/-291)
	An all-girls [Catholic high school] in [Morristown], NJ run by old smelly nuns and filled with geeks and ugly losers with no social lives. A typical [Villa] girl is hairy and unclean and repulsive. Usually, Villa girls wish they were remotely as good looking, attractive, and fun as a St. E's girl. However, this will never be accomplished.
		Example: [Seton Hall] Boy #1: Is that a girl or [a dog]?
		
		Seton Hall Boy #2: [A Dog]

	(2006-05-08 +75/-248)
	An all-girls school located in [Morristown], New Jersey.  It is run by smelly old nuns and is always compared with st. e's. Of course everyone is aware that [the villa] girls mascot was the knight a few years back, but the [delb] boys and [shp] boys started calling them the villa gorillas because they look like gorillas. (st. es girls are called st. [easies] because villa girls cant get boys even if they paid them so they think that st. e's girls are easy) They think they are too smart for st. es but the fact is, they made the gorilla their MASCOT.  So now they smell, look, and are gorillas.  St. E's beats villa ten out of ten times without cheating.  Thats another thing, villa girls cheat in sports to win because they dont have the proper skill level to win [farely]. 
		Example: St. Es Girl: Why are [the villa] girls called gorillas, i thought you liked them?
		
		[Delb] boys: (laugh) pshhhhhhh they should in the zoo!!
		
		[Villa Walsh Academy] (VWA) is a not a school, its a zoo.

Still tagged as the Greatest [Dunker] of All Time, his display of artistry in dunking was demonstrated in the 2000 [Slam Dunk] Contest through his originality/creativity (the 360 windmill, the first mid-air-catch between the legs dunk, elbow hang, and later on [the dunk] which he literally jumped OVER a 7 [footer] which was considered the greatest dunk of all time) and flair as it fired the imagination of many basketball fans. The man who completely redefined the word "Dunk" and turned post-2000 [slam dunk] contests inferior to the one in which he participated.

	d)  A basketball player who now plays for the New Jersey Nets after a requested trade because of his frustration with losing and made the RIGHT choice because he was beginning to age and had to move on.

	Combat System
	
	Vindictus will be using the Source engine to allow players to interact extensively with the environment. Environmental objects can be destroyed or picked up and wielded as weapons. Combat is described as "kind of brutal, like a bullfight," and will require a lot of teamwork.
	Classes
	
	Vindictus' "Classes" and "characters" are one and the same. When beginning the game, players have a choice to play as one of three characters, each of which has different combat skills and abilities. Players are free to alter certain aspects of their character's appearance, but basic abilities and combat styles are set at character creation. They are gender-locked.

	Violas are very loud and energetic. They hold a grudge very easily and are kind of salty. Violas tend to [get excited] easily and are always happy. She is adored by people due to her looks and her contagious personality. She is very funny and has a very cute laugh. Violas tend to make impulsive decisions and do not think them through. Be careful, the results are sometimes [disastrous]. She is very bold and unique. She has beautiful eyes. She does not get offended easily. If someone is insulted she will stand up for them and take the blame. She is strong willed and determined. She is a friend for life and a great companion. Even though she tends to hold on to the past a little bit, all she needs is a push! If you have a Viola in your life, you know how much of a handful she is. Violas always think with their heart.

	Larger than [the violin] but smaller than the [cello]. It sounds sort of chocolaty, but playing it is difficult because it's range is fit in an instrument like 30 % too small. Like the 2nd best instrument in the orchestra, behind cello. Often [underappreciated], but it's really one of the best instruments out there. Violists themselves are quite eccentric- a big bundle of different personalaties.
		Example: The violas like to call themselves the meat of the orchestra sandwich, which basically means that they like to hide under the pieces of bread rather than call too much attention to themselves. Violists have to struggle with an instrument whose range is forced into a sounding body of air which is perhaps 30 percent smaller than the acoustically appropriate volume. This makes for a constant quest for the ideal [viola] sound (which some would say would be the viola sitting in its case) and the distinct air of the [absent-minded professor] amongst violists. If you need someone to fix your computer, start with the [viola section].

	(2009-10-04 +45/-20)
	A [orchestra] instrument which can actually get a [college education]! Violin people only make fun of the [viola] because they have no talent and viola people are smart asses :D

		Violist~What?
		Violinst~What is the longest viola joke?
		Violist~Harold in Italy!I've heard this dumb as joke so many times!People like you can't even invent one so they use the same dumb ass one!

Since the NCAA doesn't [regulate] controlled substance use for fear of losing half their great athletes, they allow the individual schools to regulate how much marijuana their athletes smoke. If an individual athlete smokes so much weed that he/she is dumb enough to get [caught red-handed] smoking or selling, that athlete is suspended for a game in his/her respected sport (Unless [Lane Kiffin] is the coach in which case it is a mere half game).
		Example: Mark: Yo [Weezy], I just gotz me some of the best herb, you wanna go VTR with me?
		
		Weezy: Oh hellz [yeayuh]. Lets be [in Violation] of Team Rules!!! (pulls out a bong)

	A 3 piece punk-folk-rock-band from Milwaukee.  Relatively well known to generation X-ers for their college anthems ("Add it Up" "[Blister in the Sun]" "[Kiss Off]" "Gimme the Car").  
	
	They consist of Gordon [Gano] (Vocals, Guitar) Victor DeLorenzo (Drums, back up vocals) & Brian Ritchie (insane bass guitar, back up vocals - some lead).
	
	One of the greatest bands of the last 20 years, and definitely the best live act still touring today.  
	
	Unfortunately, a lot of their catalogue has been overshadowed by their #1 hit "[blister in the sun]" - one of their lesser tracks, but one that had an infectious refrain which caught the attention of the mass consciousness.
	
	They've had a few revivals (or just off mainstream revivals) over the years.  "American Music" was a big hit from "Why do birds sing", "Blister in the Sun" is a movie soundtrack favourite and Ethan [Hawke] covered "Add it Up" in [Reality Bytes].
	
	Tragically, a mini-thesis could be written on how the usage of the song "Add it Up" (and the censoring of it) within Reality Bytes represented exactly what was lacking in the movie. 
	
	Still, there are few bands with more quotable songs - and fewer bands with more rabid fans.
	
	Trivia:  Even if you haven't heard of the femmes, chances are you've heard Gordon play - as the guitarist for the Law & Order theme.
		Example: 1
		
		"Add it up"
		
		Why can't I get just one fuck?

		And I get that feeling within
		And I sigh, oh I sigh
		He draws near, very near

violinist

	They can express such vivid and passionate emotions, [the violin] isn't a mere tool, they use it as a voice for all the tenderness and melancholy of their soul.

You will love the gentle nostalgia, or will hate the loneliness and sorrow; but it will touch your soul so deep that you will have no other choice than to feel it.
	
	Otherwise the violonist would make plain sound, or horrid noise.
		Example: "World acclaimed electric violinists [Linzi] Stoppard and [Ben Lee's] new string act FUSE." Forget the dusty penguins with shit coloured instruments (no offence), Linzi is gorgeous with her custom gold electric instrument. (And without.) See her site linzistoppard.com/music to hear real violinists.
		
		Wanna be:
		"I'm gonna become famous with my new violin and make lots of money!"
		*The poor violin screams under a lack precision and passion, the poor thing crying for the mercy a bonfire.*
		Man that shit doesn't do what I want, it must be broken. [The hell with it].
		*Sells it for [boose], to lower the awareness of some already brainless chick, to fuck her a [big 5] minute of effort, while she'll do the star.*

	(noun) A clean, unused [hypodermic] [syringe] received from a [reliable source].

	(2008-11-16 +1209/-166)
	Someone who still has their virginity....if you want me to [narrow it down] even more----SOMEONE WHO HAS NOT HAD SEX YET
	
	Reasons that someone might still be a Virgin:
	
	1) Scared
	2) just not ready for it
	3) waiting til marriage for [religious reasons]
	4) has [no sex drive]
	5) not good around the opposite sex 
	
	For most virgins like myself, we are VERY horny daily resulting in frequent masturbation, porn watch( not just boys.its us girls, too), constant grinding at parties, and wet panties ( for boys, it would be trousers or boxers) 
	 
		Example: Im [suprised] im still a virgin, girl.
		
		Im a [horny virgin].
		
		[Virgins] are slowly becoming extinct.....

	(2018-12-16 +187/-28)
	A smart person that's never [fu]¬¢ed up their lives [going at it] with [a jerk], they'll break up with in a month.
		Example: [I'm a virgin].

	(2008-06-15 +3728/-944)
	Someone who has never had penetrative sex.
	
	Honestly, it is really not that [big of a deal] to be a virgin. Some people get [embarassed] admitting it and some people even get made fun of, even by other virgins for being a virgin. 
	
	First of all, if someone would make fun of you for never having sex, then they are not the type of person who you should be telling your personal romantic business to. And who really cares if for ladies, you have had a dick [uncomfortably] and awkwardly stuck into a part of your body that rarely sees the light, and for guys, you stuck your dick into a weird, slimy hole?
		Example: I am saving [my virginity] for love, and this does not [embarass] me at all. In fact, I'm proud of the fact that I know I will not get an STD or end up with [an abortion] during high school.

	(2009-01-01 +954/-253)
	A virgin is a smart individual that has not engaged in sexual intercourse, anal or oral sex, and not because they [churchies] or ugly but because they have common sense. They don't want a bunch of little kids [runnin] around or some genital ripping [sexually transmitted disease]. 
		Example: [Kiki] is a virgin because when she gives it up, she wants to be driving [that person's] car, having their kids, living in their house. Wait, that sounds like a marriage. Hmm. [I wonder why].

	(2018-06-01 +408/-106)
	[Smart people] who decide to save themselves for marriage or be one till they die. [Sex is overrated] anyways. Virgins are clean and pure and never had sex. I think everybody should be virgins until marriage, but people nowadays have no [self control]. Yes its true, they exist.
		Example: "I am [a virgin], [I never] had [sex]."

	(2005-07-24 +7646/-2721)
	Meaning one who has not yet had sex. 
	
	Many choose to remain [a virgin] for a period of time that they see fit (for many, this means until they are married, or find someone they love), others are a virgin due to not yet having had the chance to lose their virginity. [A virgin] is often seen as a rare and [beautiful thing].

		Example: "I may [choose] to never have sex, and [if I] choose that, I will forever be known as [a virgin]"

Virginia Military Institute
	(2007-08-17 +109/-17)
	The epitome of a senior military college.  Located in the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains in Lexington, Virginia, the Virginia Military Institute was once home to the finest military leaders serving our country since the Civil War.
	
	The school was founded based on the principles of Cincinatus and the "[Citizen Soldier]" concept of societal members.  Leaders in industry during peace, and leaders in combat during war.  [The cadets] of the Virginia Military Institute were [mobilized] during the Civil War and marched over 80 miles from Lexington to [New Market] to join the ranks during the Confederate victory at that battleground.
	
	The entire atmosphere of the school is of a spartan feel, with very little comforts in the barracks rooms, cold conrete courtyards, and stone constructed civil war era buildings.  The corps of cadets forms up on the "bricks" in front of barracks for accountability formations before every meal, and typically performs two to three formal military parades per week on the post drill field.
		Example: Virginia [Military] Institute, [the nations] first state [military] [college].

	(2007-08-20 +140/-24)
	The nation's first state-supported military college, founded on November 11, [1839]. It is located in the small town of Lexington, Virginia, and has been turning out leaders for every walk of life since its inception -- unlike certain other colleges located in Charleston, South Carolina. The [Ratline], the initial period of cadetship for all new cadets(Rats), is generally viewed as the toughest initiation of any military college in the country. It also has the distinction of being one of only three schools in the world to have fought as a single military unit in pitched battle at the Battle of [New Market] on May 15, 1864.
		Example: The Virginia Military Institute is [the best] [military school] in [the United States of America].

virginia run
	(2007-11-06 +62/-52)
	[Virginia Run] is a suburb located on the outskirts of [Centreville] VA next to a farm and a rock quarry. Virginia Run is where white people live to get away from the blacks and many illegal immigrants who also live in Centreville.
	
	The area is a typical [tract housing] suburban development. Some of Virginia Runs houses are typical 3-4 bedroom tract houses, and some are typical McMansion developments. Residents of Virginia Run are proud of their McMansions with 7 bedrooms for their 2.4 kids and their 3-4 car garages with their 2-3 cars. They are also proud of their lawns which constitute a ¬º acre plot of land mostly filled with the sprawling monstrosity of a house with a surrounding 1 foot wide border of grass constituting the yard.
	
	The houses were built with [square footage] and large looking appearance being the prime factors not quality or style. All the houses exhibit the typical mass produced ‚Äúcookie cutter‚Äù corner cutting methods: only 3-4 different styles of houses that repeat every 3-4 houses, brick front treatment but [vinyl siding] on the sides and back, window [shutters] only on the fronts with bare frames on the back and sides.
	
	Residents are almost all extremely bourgeoisie and kitschy. Their McMansions are filled with Country Americana d√©cor from [gingham] seat covers, couches, and table cloths to paintings on saw blades to tacky wallpaper to frilly wooden dolls to Thomas Kinkade paintings, flanked by 60‚Äù TV sets and surround sound systems. The epitome of classless and style-less conspicuous consumption. Many residents also own a Lexus ES class, which everyone knows is just a dressed up Toyota Camry.
	
	Virginia Run residents belong to the upper middle class populace (just like the rest of white [northern VA] residents) but somehow think that they are more than that. What they fail to realize is that by living in an undesirable area, the boonies/sticks, 30 miles away from culture, means they increase their buying power, not actual wealth. 
	
	Despite the fact that residents pretend to be rich, they worry immensely about the [property value] of their McMansions, so much that they have selected ridiculously strict home owners association rules that regulate everything and will give owners a written notice or fine if their [garage doors] are left open or they have a [moveable] basketball net setup in the street or if their 20 square feet of grass isn‚Äôt meticulously maintained less the property value of their houses decline.
		Example: [Virginia Run] residents don‚Äôt understand that [Great Falls] and Old Town Alexandria is where upper middle class people in VA live with taste.
		
		Virginia Run residents who think they know what rich is have never been to Manhattan NY or [Greenwich CT].

	(2005-12-13 +48/-102)
	A ridiculously wealthy suburban community in Northern Virginia where $500,000 houses are crappy and are the houses that the poor people live in. It is within 20 miles of 4 highschool, 6 elementary schools, and about 6 middle schools. People who grew up or live in [Virginia Run] are rich, usually have 3 car garages, own at least 1 lexus and a Mercedes SUV for fun, and there are no houses with less than 5 huge bedrooms. Virginia Runners think that London [Towne] is the "ghetto." We always get stuck in traffic, and everyone who lives in Virginia Run has goten a ticket on [Pleasant Valley] Road at some point in their life in their BMW. The worst crime commited in Virginia Run is a 10 year old ringing your doorbell then running behind a bush to see your reaction. IN [virginia run], there are several commitees of bored housewives who determine what color ur [shutters] and doors can be, the way your garden and yard can look, and what kind of [swing set] you may have in your back yard. Basically, Virginia Run is where the rich people who hate southern virginia live.
		Example: I live in the second wealthiest county in the nation, [Fairfax County], and drive my lexus to school everyday, because i am from [virginia run]. My [shutters] match my door, and my garden got yard of the month 3 times in a row.

virginia tech
	(2005-04-09 +1537/-572)
	I just want to point one thing out here.  UVA and VT are completly different schools.  If you want a [law degree] or business degree, you go to UVA.  However they cant even touch Virgina [Tech's] Engineering and Science programs.  Both schools are commpletely respectable institutions of learning, but for different areas of study.  The demographics are different, with UVA being more preppy and upper class, and VT students having a more casual demeanor and coming from middle class backgrounds.  There are rednecks at VT, but most dont make it past freshman year. 
	Oh, and no one really cares about the Citadel/Virginia Tech rivalry.
	
	Now lets stop this rediculous rivalry and stop comparing [apples to oranges].
		Example: ~I want to major [in electrical] engineering with a minor in mathematics, so i think i will go to [Virginia Tech].
		
		~Thats cool, i want to major in business manegment and become an entrepreneur so i will go to [UVA].
		
		~Awesome, i respect your decision because we have different tastes in education.

	(2007-04-19 +325/-385)
	The site of [the deadliest] shooting spree in modern U.S. history. A social outcast named [Cho Seung-Hui] took 32 innocent lives on [April 16th], 2006, before taking his own life. May all of the victims rest in peace, and may Cho Seung-Hui forever burn in Hell. 
		Example: [Virginia Tech] is a college in [Blacksburg] [VA].

	(2004-12-05 +289/-379)
	School that unlike the previous fuckers definition that i had to chang! [Virginia Tech] is the best school in the state of VA and so I have to correct this [tosser's] inaccuracies!
	
	1. The school is full of extremely smart, relatively diverse, and nice people
	2. The girls at Virginia Tech are very respectable, pretty, and just really fun to hang with
	
	3. Last but not least the students who attend this university don't smell like shit and only a small [pecent] are rednecks. Oh, incase you didn't know [VT] hates West Virginia. So nexttime you wanna fuck with VT, I'll come down to the community college and give your ass a beating you'll never forget. Then you'll come home, go to this website and create a word called the [Hokie] Asskicking!
		Example: Wow, [UVA] can [suck my balls] cuz all they are are stupid fuckers who pop their [coller] and screw their roommates.

	(2006-02-20 +255/-340)
	School in [Virginia] that has two upsides; 1) [engineering] 2) football (with [rapists]). But any other major is someone who is inferior but thinks that they are sweet. 
		Example: What do kids that go to The University ([UVA]), The College ([William and Mary]), and [Virginia Tech] have in common? 
		
		They all got into tech.

	(2006-03-04 +230/-305)
	After being accepted to both [UVA] and VT among other schools, I chose VT over UVA.  I didn't want to learn to be a pussy (i.e. someone who thinks having money or being a prep-of-sorts will somehow save your ass when it's getting beaten for walking down the street and mouthing off at a [Hokie] like me who's income comes from beating the shit outta people), so UVA was [out of the question].  
	VT is the place to go unless you wanna be a lawyer, artist, writer or some other liberal jerk-me-off pro.
		Example: [Virginia is for] lovers, [University of Virginia] is for guy-on-guy lovers, [Virginia Tech] is for guy-on-girl lovers

	(2003-12-19 +218/-301)
	The best school for learning to be a man! I don't know what [the Citadel's] problem is, but I'm just about ready to [open a can] of [whoop ass] on their puppy butts.
		Example: [The Citadel] is the bitch of the [Corp] of Cadets at [Virginia Tech].

	(2005-04-14 +212/-296)
	The school of [Hokie] great and NFL Star Michael [Vick], or should I say [Ron Mexico] - the herpes sex offender.  And then there is his little brother, current Hokie Marcus "I wanna be like R. Kelly" Vick.  Great family, great school...
		Example: I could make an [example] of the above [definition], but that could get a [little nasty]....

	(2007-08-26 +130/-194)
	A school that resides somewhere in the southern part of Virginia.  The students and alumni have a large inferiority complex and must refer to themselves as the [Hokie] Nation.  Previously, their only claim to fame was Michael Vick.  Suddenly, Vick has nothing to do with [VPI]...Even though he was with Frank Beamer at the 2007 [NFL draft] holding a VT hat, days after killing dogs with his own hands.
		Example: The [Hokie] Nation of [Virginia Tech] was crushed after they lost all their games in [October] and November for the 15th straight year.

	(2005-03-30 +241/-404)
	Sub-standard school in [Virginia] [ranking] near the bottom of the in-state college heirarchy. Most notable for being filled with rednecks and [morons].
		Example: HS Senior #1: Where do you want to go to school?
		
		HS Senior #2: I WANT to go to UVA, I'll probably go to [JMU], but if [Blue Ridge] and [Piedmont] turn me down I'll go to Tech.

	(2007-10-23 +181/-311)
	I‚Äôm sorry but [Virginia Tech] is a sad excuse of a university. First of all you don‚Äôt take rankings from [the 70]‚Äôs and think that they are still relevant. Your prized engineering school isn‚Äôt even in the top 10 not to mention that it‚Äôs not even the best in the state that title would go to [VCU]. The [Pamplin] College of Business isn‚Äôt 41st in the nation like the Virginia Techs web site says, it not even close to the top 50. Yes Tech has a good football team but you are not a football school, for that you actually have to win the national title. Tech student are to dumb to get in [UVA] and must like the sausage fest not to go to [JMU].
	Oh and JMU has a better business school then you do. Virginia Tech needs to get off there high horse and start picking up its sh*t because that‚Äôs all a Virginia Tech alumni will ever amount to, the world needs ditch [diggers]. UVA is such a better school you cant even compare it to Virginia Tech.

Then he felt like shit and ashamed of his penis.

	(2011-04-24 +17/-6)

	[Something] that will [be with] me [forever].
		Example: I‚Äôm [a virgin]. And [virginity] will [live long and prosper]. Most likely.

	(2012-03-25 +407/-58)
	Something, which once [given] can't be [taken] [back].
		Example: Virginity is kinda like a [soap bubble]: all it takes is one little [prick] and then it's [gone].

	(2013-12-21 +90/-23)
	Having yet [shared] your [emotional depth] with an individual who holds [great value] to you.
		Example: 1. Losing my [virginity] was how I knew Thomas was who I wanted to marry.
		2. [Mourning] the death of my father, caused me to lose the virginity that had [distanced] my mother and me.
		3. I lost my virginity last night, my roommate and I stayed up the whole time discovering how much we love the same books.

	(2012-04-11 +202/-67)
	Something you're lucky to have if you're [13] in the [modern] [generation]. (Not having sex)
		Example: [13 year old girl]: I lost [my virginity] two years ago.
		[16 year old] boy: Dayum' girl, wanna fuck?

	(2010-11-04 +1118/-486)
	Something that [disappeared] from [America] long [ago].
		Example: [Tessa]: I lost [my virginity] yesterday!
		Bob: Aren't you thirteen?
		[Tess]: Going on fourteen!
		Bob: Slut.

	(2006-07-31 +1404/-781)
	The greatest gift a woman or [man can] give to someone. You can only lose your virginity once, if you take someone's virginity, you have taken something that they can never get back: it's irreplaceable. As this is the first time someone has sex, the presence of the [hymen] will make this the [tightest] fuck.
		Example: Parker: Guess what man.
		Alex: What?
		Parker: I took [Christina's] [virginty].
		Alex: [God damn you], I wanted Christina's virginity.
		Parker: Haha, sucks to be you.

	(2009-08-04 +472/-294)
	A [mythological] noun that determines the [purity] of someone. It is kept with a person until the first time they engage in sexual activity, and then it is lost forever.
	
	Guys must be careful; make sure that the girl whom you take the [virginity] from is a good one. If you try to leave this girl, she will use it to try to make you feel lower than dirt, and it will hit hard.
		Example: Girl: "You took [my virginity]! You took something that nobody else can have! I can never get it back, do you get that?"
		
		Boy: "Oh [shuddup], like [Matt's] pierced tounge and your vibrator are any different from my cock."

	(2005-04-23 +915/-628)
	Supposedly a personal trait that makes one "pure". Unfortunately, the very knowledge of it seems to have unintented effects.
	
	For men, it makes them feel ashamed that they have it because they think it represents [immaturity] or something along that line. For women, it makes them lie that they have it because they think it makes them less of a slut.
	
	For the religious and/or conservative, [having it] makes them believe they're imbued with magical powers, which may remain ONLY if they lose their [virginity] in marriage.
		Example: College Geek: I still have [my virginity]...
		
		[College Whore]: I still have my virginity!
		
		College [Professor]: I still have my powers!

	(2012-08-02 +36/-23)
	The state of not having had penetrative sex. Someone who is in this state is termed a virgin. [Losing it] tends to hurt, mostly for women, but sometimes for men as well. It also has a [fuckload] of meaning in society (pardon the pun). Men see it as a curse, women keep it for one reason or the other. Why?
	
	For men, getting laid for the first time is harder than hitting a [hole-in-one] (again I apologize for my punnyness). Dudes don't know the cues and technique to woo effectively at first. The faster one loses it, the more experience and confidence earned compared to one's peers, the easier courtship becomes, the easier it is to find ms right and get bizay.
	
	Women keep it because its so easy to lose for them. If one is at least disturbingly average, all she needs to do is ask. So women value it, and it gains more interest than [harvard's] endowment did over the last century. Of course, women don't value it as much in men b/c men tend to suck the first time.
	
	For both sexes of course, regardless of their stance, [losing it] is pretty fucking magical. There are also those [crazy mofos] who believe virginity is the key (or [keyhole]) to heaven....which sorta explains why losing it is so pretty fucking magical.
	
	Oh and for you [asswipes] out there, virginity is *given*, equally by both men and women. It cannot be a "taking" if you give it and should not be actually taken from anybody, male or female. Semantics, people! They most certainly DO fucking matter!
		Example: Dude 1: "I'm getting laid tonight!"
		Dude 2: "Shut the fuck up, ya fuckin virgin. Make me a sammich!"
		
		Girl 1: "That's it, no more waiting. [I'm losing it]."
		Girl 2: "Don't be such a slut!"
		
		Dude: "I just lost my virginity!"
		Girl: "[PLZ STOP] PLANKING ME ALREADY!!!"
		Samuel L Jackson: "Motherfucka, do I have to read you a motherfuckin script!?! Thrust, mothafucka, I said thrust!"
		
		Dude: 8----------->
		Girl: "This is my first time"
		Dude: 8---------------------------------------------->
		
		Han Solo: "Let the virginity be with you."
		Luke Skywalker: "Man, fuck you! I [frenched] my sister for crying out loud! I am scarred for life! You are such a dick!"
		Han: "Shut the fuck up n make me a sammich."

virii
	(2003-10-14 +261/-181)
	[Virii] is in fact an [INCORRECT] pluralization of "[virus]", however, some retard keeps resubmitting it as the plural form.
		Example: 1 4m [k00l], 1 c4n wr173 [l33tz0r] 'virii' 1n v15u4l b451c 5cr1p7.. ph33r [m3h].

	(2003-05-14 +199/-163)
	[Incorrect] pluralization of "[virus]", used by people who want to make themselves look [smarter].
		Example: "[My computer] is [infected] with virii! I am also a [moron]."

	(2005-09-08 +133/-117)
	[Virii] defines a category of software that is comprised of viruses, worms and [trojans].  The general usage of the word is to describe a collection of software.
	Virii itself is a plural word as there is no need for a singluar form because the more descriptive singular form of {virus, worm, or [trojan]} could be used.
	Virii is not the plural form of virus (which is viruses).  Virii has nothing to do with biological viruses.
		Example: Correct: I have a huge [collection] of virii!
		[Incorrect]: I got a virii on [my computer].

	(2005-01-12 +68/-101)
	virii is a variant plural of the word 'virus'
	It is important to note it is actually incorrect and the correct plural for 'virus' is 'viruses'
	People use virii instead of [viruses] because
	a) it looks 'better' or they want to appear of as smarter
	b) [they don't know] it is incorrect
	c) it sounds 'better' when said (vi-ree) compared to viruses (vi-rus-is)
	If you use 'virii' people will [announce] 'your' mistake - use virii/viruses
		Example: [Virii] can often [reproduce] itself via email [attachments].

	(2003-11-10 +61/-91)
	Refers to people from planet virus. People who use this word usually received their [GED] two years after graduating from Sally [Struthers] University with degree in TV/[VCR] repair.
		Example: I was using my computer and noticed i was infected with some virii right before i was [abducted] and was [anally] [probed].

	(2002-12-21 +67/-106)
	[Plural] [form] of [virus].
		Example: This [person's] [computer] was [loaded] with virii.

	(2007-08-07 +30/-60)
	The form virii would not have been a correct plural, since the ending -ii only occurs in the plural of masculine and feminine words ending in -ius. For instance, take radius, plural [radii]: the root is radi-, with the singular ending -us and the plural -i. Thus the plural virii is that of the nonexistent word   virius  . The form [viri] would also be incorrect in Latin. The ending -i is normally used for masculine or feminine nouns, not [neuter] ones such as virus; moreover, viri (albeit with a short i in the first syllable) is the plural of [vir], and means "men."
	
	[excerpt] from

		Example: I have both strains of [the retard] virii

	(2004-02-06 +33/-74)

		Example: [Linux] doesn't get as [many] virii

Virtua Fighter
	(2003-07-19 +94/-28)
	Dead or Alive IS a ripoff of Virtua Fighter, except the reason why [DOA] is way more popular than [VF] is because the female characters have big, beautiful, breasts that bounce when they move or jump, and skirts so short that you can see their panties........excuse me while I go [play Dead] or Alive 3.
		Example: I still haven't played [the XBOX] version of Vurtua Fighter 4 yet.  [I hear that] the gameplay is [based off of] Virtua Fighter 2 which was a pretty cool game.

	(2003-09-08 +92/-46)
	The reason why people [ditch] this game in favor of [Tekken] is because Virtua Fighter is too [realistic].
		Example: I'd rather have my characters fly 30 [feet in the air] after I make a [flashy] [uppercut].

	(2004-06-18 +121/-69)
	If America knows the difference between treasure and trash, we wouldn't have talentless media whores like Britney Spears, Nelly, Eminem, [Puff Daddy] and [Jennifer Lopez] turning the concept of music into a joke.  We wouldn't be [bored to death] with MTV, talk shows, reality TV and soap operas.  We would have honest people running our government.  And we definitely wouldn't have so many shitty videogames clogging up the Playstation line of consoles.
		Example: Americans just hate Virtua Fighter because it doesn't allow for you to [randomly] button-mash your way to [victory], and it doesn't have pretty [flashes] of light.

	(2003-02-18 +61/-42)
	The first 3d polygon fighting game made by SEGA in 1992.  It was followed by Virtua Fighter 2 (1994), Virtua Fighter 3(1997), and Virtua Fighter 4 (2001).  Still the most innovative and realistic 3D fighting game series in existence, since it attempts to mimic real moves and physics as closely as possible.  Since [Virtua Fighter's] creation, there have been a slew of half-assed ripoffs such as [NAMCO's] Tekken series, and Team [Ninja's] Dead or Alive series.
		Example: Virtua [Fighter] 2 is still the best and most original [3D] [fighter] of all time.  Virtua Fighter 4 doesn't count, since it's [based off of] Virtua Fighter 2

	(2003-05-11 +51/-42)
	[VF] = Better graphics, physics, GAMEPLAY, [REPLAYABILITY], [LASTABILITY]!!!
	Teken = Better ways to mash buttons, better flashes, better CHEAP factor.
		Example: [Ron] Obvious is a dumbass to say that [Tekken] has better [gameplay] than Virtua Fighter.

	(2003-12-17 +23/-54)
	A 3d fighter with sluggish controles and boring charecters. The graphics were ok at the time (Ah who Im kidding even the dated [King Of Fighters] engine looked better thatn this [crap fest]) It is fairly complicated wich can turn off new players. This series is not newb freindly....at all. I will say however that it is fairly addictive and there is enough for fans to enjoy. 
	 As for those who do not enjoy the super floaty jumps those were pretty much invented in [VF].
		Example: I wish the [VF] series played a bit [faster].
		 All these charecters feel a bit [cliche] and I cant seem to find one I particulary like playing as.
		 Well at least VF4EVO is pretty

	(2005-04-28 +25/-66)
	There is nothing fun about the [Virtua Fighter] games. The music is tacki and droaning. [The specials] are dull and crummy. The speed is slower than sluggish and the gameplay is [deader] than a graveyard.
	
	The characters are clear rip offs of characters from the Street fighter and Tekken gammes.
	
	Oh yes and [Virtua fighter] is not realistic, when I jump I dont think I slowly hover to the floor or when I knock someone over I dont think it takes them half a millenia to get up. Your just making up excuses for [Virtua] Fighters slow downs and fatal flaws.
	
	Dead or Alive is NOT a rip off of Virtua Fighter, in fact the series have nothing in common besides the same fighting engine. But oh would you look at that even though they do Dead or Alive actually has realistic jumps and characters dont move like turtles.
	
	I rest my case
		Example: [Virtua fighter] is [a slow] [repetitive] boring old series that has long since past its sell by date

	(2003-02-26 +16/-52)
	[VF]=better graphics,physics
	[Tekken]=better [gameplay]
		Example: 

	(2003-07-06 +11/-48)
	A game that have a slow [reaction time] and was focused to much on the graphics instead of the gameplay...that's why its never have such of a big [sucess] like Tekken [Dead or Alive] or Street Fighter.
		Example: If Virtua Fighter is such a [great game] then how it haven't gotten over America...its not that America is lazy its just that America knows [the difference] between [treasure] and trash.

Virtual Boy
	(2003-11-18 +86/-8)
	A video game system that was sold for $20 at Toys 'R' Us about 3 weeks after it came out. Users compained about sore eyes and [headaches]. Nintendo eventually said "[Screw it]", and Virtual Boy [faded into] the Abyss of Lost Consoles.
		Example: Virtual Boy was supposed to be the [successor] to [Game Boy], but we all know [how that] turned out...

	(2007-03-26 +42/-21)
	[Nintendo's] only system that failed. It had red [monochrome] graphics that looked like lasers. It sucked in and [breathed] out fart. After it failed, thousands of virtual boys were crushed and recycled into fully funtional dildos. Failed because the games suck ballsack skin and your eyes would die after an hour of gameplay.
		Example: Guy: Oh my god, dude, I just bought a rare Virtual Boy on [eBay]!
		
		[Freind]: "How much was it?"
		
		Guy: $500. It was a classic.
		
		Freind shankes him in the [liver].

	(2009-09-06 +32/-17)
	When two people decide to [watch a movie] or a tv show at the [same time], while instant messaging. Usually requires a [countdown] to start so that both parties are watching the video at the exact same time and therefore comment on it as if they actually were together.
		Example: Person: "What did you do last night?"
		Me: "My girlfriend couldn't go out, so her and I [virtual] [dated] to the new episode of [How I met Your Mother]."

virtual family kingdom

	[Virtual Family Kingdom] is a magical place where [ignorance is bliss]. It was a clever ploy to take advantage of noobs and [creep out] anyone who knows a thing or two about MMOs and laws pertaining to them. Unfortunately for the game's creators, people are on to their scheme.
		Example: I would play [Virtual Family Kingdom], but I don't [enjoy] games that [smell].

	A horrid game [greated] by third party people. Made to [quell] kids who were sad the [VMK] closed. It actually bares almost no resembalance to VMK, has hardly any gameplay, and doesn't take place in "the past." You're just a clay doll walking around in some backgrounds.
	Complete with memberships to steal your money.
		Example: Hey kids! Instead of meeting up in Runescape or some other actually good game, come to Virtual Family Kingdom! Remember those fun times in [VMK]! Well this is nothing like it! Also Remember, founders [get a HORSE] MANG! Pls give us [mony] pls!

	(2011-06-23 +15/-21)
	After [VMK] shut down, some people in Arizona decided to take advantage of it and create a copy-cat named [VFK]. While it's nothing like VMK, [it's better than nothing]. It needs new role-players though.
	
	And it's filled with annoying wolves too.

	3. A test designed to measure the stupidity of the [average internet user] by seeing how many of them open up infected [attachments] in emails, despite thousands of warnings not to be so dumb.

	A virus is created from those social pariahs known as [Hax0rs]. These exiled individuals have been excreted from societys lowly depths and have evolved into the robust, 200 pound entitys that remain [undisclosed] in there parents basments forced to a life of sitting in a chair in dark surroundings with the simpsons on. They reject the sun for fear of skin pigment. With there knowledge of DOS and [Visual basic] they create what the bielve to be Godlike Programs called viruses. These viruses are designed to travel through the use of either direct ip connections or the spread through email, [p2p], and other network connections. They in entity are simple and small programs with the command to infect [registry] files most commonly hidden files such as the WIN 32 Directory. once established they replicate themselves in [emulation] to a real [viral infection] but this virus does not attack the immune system. It instead becomes a memmory hog by sucking system power and changing system settings in order to protect itself. The best way to protect yourself against a virus is to not get infected in the first place. Do not download attachments from email even if it says its from somone u know as it could be a virus sent through that contacts address book. If you simply must use a p2p application create a seperate share file in which ur files downloaded go then use a virus protection software to monitor, and [quarintine] that folder. If you bielve you have downloaded a [trojen] virus (which is a program created so a the person on the other end can interact with your computer) then pull out your network connection imiedietly as to prevent that person on the other end from doing any further damage. A trojen is most of the time harmless because [rarley] do other people know how to use them. They are set up in this standard: Client and server. You are sent the server and the hacker has the client sort of a master and slave theory. 
	
	heres a tip: Do not run multiple virus software as they will try to compete with eachother and essentially do not work propperly. I suggest visiting www.[download.com] and try [AVAST]. You could also get a subscription service like norton and [mcafee]. also remember that virus software always needs to be updated and quite freqwently or else its [ussless] as viruses constanly change and [new definitions] are added.
	
	Also keep firewalls active but just like software do not have competing firewalls. Windows xp [sp2] has an integrated [firewall] but if that doesnt fit your bill you could try zone alarm. 
	
	Install a router, seems like everyone has em now anyway but it does keep you hidden. For those who know how to port forward be weary of your virtual ports. check them freaqwently to see if theres any activity. Theres reports of viruses being active in bittorent protocal also. 
	MOST IMPORTANT: never giv your I.P. to anyone.
		Example: "I am a maligment [program] created for the purpose of [infection] and [replication]"

	(2006-06-19 +67/-22)

	[Windows Vista] is Microsoft's upcoming operating system (OS), due to be released in December of 2006. It will be the most powerful and most technologically advanced system in history, and will integrate web security into it's core (unlike all other Microsoft Products).
	     
	It will be the first system using [DirectX] 10, which is supposedly a big step forward in graphics technology. Halo 2 will be released ONLY for [Vista], as an incentive. Also, [Flight Simulator] 2006 (aka [FSX]) will be released, and will unleash the next generation of simulated flight.
	
	Microsoft has received much criticism due to excessive focus on visual features, rather than performance, within Windows Vista. Also, the price of Vista Ultimate is expected to be in the [appauling] $200-400 range, which may possibly worsen Microsoft's low sales (due to the XBOX 360).
	
	Recently, they have received immense criticism for Microsoft's security and privacy settings, and have been accused of making spyware, known as the [WGA] (Windows Genuine Notification). Unfortunately, this technology will be integrated and unremovable from Vista, which also may decrease their popularity and sales.
	     
	[System requirements] also pose an issue to many consumers, due to their lack of the latest technology, which is QUITE out of reach to most, due to price. Microsoft recommends Vista users to have Dual-Core 64-bit Processors, and at LEAST 1GB Dual-Channel DDR2 Memory, and PCI-Express Motherboards. These features are still extremely expensive at this time, and with people not having access to it, Vista will have dramatically less copies sold.
	     
	Pirated copies of Windows Vista will not function, due to "genuine-technology", so millions of users from third-world countries may be stuck with Windows XP or earlier versions.
	     
	Last, but certainly not least, [Internet Explorer 7] will be released with Windows Vista, and is said to be "much improved, secure and optimized", however many users will not be using it due to [IE's] history and lack of trust for Microsoft's browser.
		Example: Tom: ...and you know how bad IE is-
		Joe: IE 7 is supposed to be really good!
		Tom: I don't give a s**t, [Firefox] is better-
		Joe: BUT-

		Joe: Ok.... (sad) Anyway, I can't wait for FS2006, FS2004 Sucked!
		Tom: I know, but your computer isn't good enough, and you can't afford [Vista].
		Joe: Ok.... (crying) What about Halo 2?

	While a windows program with a graphical user interface in C++ may take months in terms of laying the [groundwork] and [API] necessary to perform certain functions, the [Visual Basic] equivalent could take ten minutes.
		Example: C++ Programmer: Hey man! What are you programming?
		Visual Basic Programmmer: I'm writing something to find all the music tracks on my computer and write their file paths into an [m3u] playlist. 
		C++ Programmer: Wow! How long have you been working on that?? It sounds really intense!
		[Visual Basic Programmer]: 10 minutes.. and I'll be done in another 5.
		
		C++ Programmer: Dude, if you were l33t like me, you would be programming in C++.
		Visual Basic: Really? Right now I'm writing an FTP Server! What was the last thing you programmed?
		C++ Programmer: Um, I wrote tic tac toe..
		Visual Basic Programmer: Really? For Windows? That's pretty cool.
		C++ Programmer: Actually its for the console.
		
		[Java Programmer]: Dude, portability is where its at. Your sleasy Visual Basic program is only good on a [Micro$hit] computer.
		Visual Basic Programmer: Yea well.. When was the last time you compiled a java app for a non Windows machine?
		Java Programmer: Actually never.
		
		Computer Science College Student who only learned C++: I have never programmed anything useful in my life. I yearn to be one of 3,000 programming a single function working on Microsoft's Windows 2020.

	A [proprietary] [programming language] developed by Microsoft to allow lazy people to code programs that only run a little bit more slowly than [raytracing] a detailed environment on a hand-operated processor.
		Example: C++ Programmer: Hey man! What are you programming?
		Visual Basic Programmmer: I'm writing something to find all the music tracks on my computer and write their file paths into an [m3u] playlist. 
		C++ Programmer: Wow! How long have you been working on that?? It sounds really intense!
		[Visual Basic Programmer]: 10 minutes.. and I'll be done in another 5.
		Perl Programmer: *walks in* Hey guys, look at this! I wrote a script to find all the music tracks on my computer and write them to an m3u playlist [in a little bit] less than 90 seconds!

	(2005-10-03 +198/-137)
	A [programming language] for morons, and people that are too stupid to learn real [programming] languages.
	
	It is commonly taught in schools and colleges, so retards can understand it and become "[leet]".
		Example: Him: [Man], [i'm cool] because [I know] Visual Basic.
		Me: No, you're not.

	A powerful RAD (rapid [application development]) progamming language that allows for easy creation of windows programs. Its main flaw is the fact that [micro$hit] made it, and therefore under their monopoly, it only runs on windows. Another complaint is about the way many new users use the language. They just paste a couple of objects on a form, user a few undeclared variables (variants, which are slow), and run the program. A real program creates objects at runtime and user delared variables at all times (forced by [Option Explicit].) Other than that, it is a good language. It is easy enough to learn for beginners (unlike other languages such as java/C++) and powerful enough to perform complicated calculations and make windows-based programs and games with readable code.
		Example: 'This is a sample [VB] program
		'It finds the prime [factors] of any number the user specifies
		'Declare Objects
		[Dim] WithEvents txtNumber As [TextBox]
		Dim WithEvents lblPrime As Label
		Dim WithEvents cmdFactor As CommandButton
		
		Private [Sub] cmdFactor_Click()
		     Dim [counter]&, answer$, number&
		     'Check to make sure user entered a valid number
		     If Not IsNumeric(txtNumber) Then Exit Sub
		     If [Len](txtNumber) = 0 Or txtNumber > 2000000000 Or [Sgn](txtNumber) = [-1] Then Exit Sub
		     'Create [variable] = to what user entered.
		     number = txtNumber
		     'factor out [2's]
		     Do While number Mod 2 = 0
		          number = number / 2
		          answer = answer & " * 2"
		     [Loop]
		     'factor out other numbers
		     For counter = 3 To number [Step 2]
		          Do While number Mod counter = 0
		               'exit when [primes] are exhausted
		               If number = 1 Then Exit Do

		          Loop
		     Next counter
		     'results
		     MsgBox Right$(answer, Len(answer) - 3), 15, "The Prime [Factors] of " & txtNumber & " are..."
		     'gives the [textbox] focus
		     txtNumber.SetFocus

	A very powerful, but yet underrated [programming language] made by Microsoft. It's a very easy language to learn, and it usually has suprisingly good results.
	
	Many people think it isn't a real programming language, but nothing could be further from the truth. It is a good language. Here is why:
	
	Most patches, trainers, and hacks made for the cool games many people play are made using [visual basic].
	
	Many programs that you can produce in visual basic are extremely lightweight.
	
	For all you C++ people who think it is a fake, waste of time language, well, not many people want to have to get a degree to know what their doing when programming. What you [make in] 1000 lines of code, you can do it in visual basic in about 2.
		Example: [Visual basic] [code]:
		
		If textbox1.text = "" then
		button1.[enabled] = false
		else
		button2.enabled = true

	someone who *thinks* they know how to program, but in reality is pretty average... almost always don't really understand the inner workings of a computer... they [get scared] by things like call stacks, registers, [pointers], assembly, or anything that has to do with the guts of a computers...  
	
	also, they are generally not smart enough to do [embedded] development...
		Example: embedded developer:  i just hacked the can bus in my car... used a philips tja1050 transceiver, paired it up to a mcf5485 [coldfire], developed the [logger] and gauge renderer in C (gasp!) using codewarrior and spat the image data out to the [tft] in my car to have virtual gauges on everything!
		
		what have you developed lately?
		
		visual basic programmer:  an ftp server...
		
		embedded developer: oh... cool...

	(2008-07-11 +15/-17)
	A unique, but yet simple langauge based highly off of the original [Visual Basic] language. Criticized by other programmers who program in languages like C++ and Java. 
	
	VB .NET uses .NET Framework, which is somewhat simple to use. It elminates having to download large bits of [runtime] files required to run earlier VB apps. If you have .NET installed, you most likely can support a VB .NET app.
	
	VB .NET is often sterotyped as being a lazy, or [noob language]. Funny, you can program the exact same thing in VB .NET as you can in C++. Oh, and easier too.
		Example: C++: Hey, what are you doing [VB] .NET?
		
		VB .NET: Oh, I'm just programming a [tabbed] web browser getting ready for distribution.
		
		C++: Oh, sounds cool, how long did that take to make?
		
		VB .NET: Oh, only about an hour.
		
		C++: Really? Wow, ironicly I'm working on the exact same thing! I'm [almost done] too!
		
		VB .NET: How long have you been working on your tabbed web beowser?
		
		C++: 5 Years. I'm thinking of switching to Visual Basic .NET.
		
		VB .NET: Good idea.

	(2006-10-14 +25/-38)
	Visual Basic .NET is the best programming language to date. Many people think it's [noobish] becuase I can create a true P2P application in the same time it takes them to [code a] message box in C\C++ or [ASM].
		Example: C\C++ Dev. - "[ZOMFG] I just made my first message box."
		[VB.NET] Dev. - "How long did it take."
		C\C++ Dev. - "Around 2 1/2 years."
		VB.NET Dev. - "Oh. I made a Napster Clone and conquered the world in half the time it took you to do that."
		C\C++ Dev. - :[-X]
		VB.NET Dev. - "Yup, Visual Basic .NET pwns."

Visual King
	(2017-04-20 +428/-205)
	A Visual King is a term to describe [Kim Seok-Jin] from BTS.
	The reason behind the term is because [Jin] trended No.1 in South Korea because he came out of a [car door], he literally shook South Korea with his beauty and grace.
		Example: "Wow, [Jin] from [BTS] is an actual Visual King"
		"Did you see Jin walking out that [car door]? Visual King, indeed"

	(2017-07-12 +95/-167)
	A [phrase] used to describe BTS' [visual]. [Kim Seokjin].
		Example: Person 1: "[The third guy] from the left? Who is he? He's so handsome!"
		Person 2: "[Ah yes], that's BTS' Visual King; [Kim Seokjin]!"

	the one. The only, [Jake sim] of enhypen.
	
	Jake's visuals are so unreal it's evident that many were attracted to him even before his debut. The first impression of people who met him k-engenes and i-engenes said he was very unreal, Enhypen 1st imp members said he was very handsome. MC from various shows always said that he was handsome. So it's been proven that he deserves the nickname 4th gen [global visual]. Everyone was whipped by the visuals of [Jake Sim] from enhypen.

visual kei
	(2003-09-01 +681/-115)
	Brand of Japanese rock music where band members (mostly men) wear elaborate make up and stage costumes, much of the time crossdressing. The "kei" is japanese for style of type, meaning "visual style music" The music ranges from 80's-esque goth rock, to heavy metal to punk and usually some combo of the 3. Most bands are indies (independant or on indies labels) but a few make it to major labels such as [Malice Mizer], Raphael, and [Dir En Grey]. Also seen written "[VK]" or sometimes incorrectly lumped in with the catch all word "Jrock", meaning all japanese rock music.
		Example: D'istray is a visual kei band.
		Cure Records and [Marder] Suitcase are [indies] [VK] labels.

	(2006-07-03 +416/-116)
	A type of Japanese Rock music ([Jrock]) meaning Visual Style Music (also known as [VK] ). Members of [Visual-Kei] bands stereotypically wear large, elaborately decorated costumes, makeup and feminine accessories. The hair is often dyed and extremely styled, or the band members will wear wigs that are easier to manage. 
	
	Usually, the [visual-kei] image is kept by indie Jrock bands. They will slowly grow out of it as they become more well known.
	
	Most of the time, [Visual Kei] bands slowly work their way out of their visual image. This is most often caused by the band being signed to a major record label. To dress more normally means they are more widely accepted, which in turn means [gross profit] for the band and label; therefore the change is usually encouraged.
	
	Contrary to popular belief, [Visual-kei] band members are generally not homosexual but dress the way they do to gain fans, to bring attention to themselves and to build a following.
	
	It is a stereotype that Visual-Kei music is crappy and the and makes up for it in looks. While it may be true that some bands sound similar, this is not true for all. Visual-kei too has it's sub-genres, and different bands may portray different looks and sounds from others.
	
	If one doesn't take the time to [delve] further into Visual-kei, or Jrock in generally, how can one give a valid or unbiased definition of it?
	By Saying only a few things, you are barely scratching the surface.
		Example: Some of the most common Visual kei bands are Dir en Grey and Malice Mizer. But both have different images.
		Malice Mizer had an 18th century goth feel.
		Dir en Grey sported a more urban goth look.
		Malice Mizer has been broken up for a number of years.
		Dir en Grey has since become more popular and have abandoned their [Visual-kei] look, since being signed to a major label.
		
		[X-Japan] was an 80's glam rock band, but they can also be called Visual-kei. The leader of the and, Yoshiki, has since been producing bands in both Japan and America.
		
		Some indie Visual-kei ands are CodomoA, Sugar Trip, Lolita 23q, Death Rabbits and [Girugamesh].

	(2007-06-03 +175/-83)
	[Visual-kei] is a movement born in the early 80's in Japan, it's about music and image at the same time. Visual-kei band members use makeup and dress up in a very eccentric way. Members of these bands make a dramatization of their music on stage and their image helps them on it. Individualism is what Visual-kei people look for, not to be part of society so to speak.
	
	The dramatization of their music is an influence of [Kabuki] theatre.
	
	Their music is a bit difficult to classify, but most of Visual-kei bands follow a pattern to make music, although nowadays their music has been very influenced by western music. If someone wants to know how Visual-kei sounds like, go to bands like: [Baiser], [Pierrot], Dir en grey (Visual-kei times), Noir Fleurir, Aliene Ma'riage, [Lareine], Vidoll, etc.
	
	Visual-kei is [not gothic] as some people think since Visual-kei bands with gothic influence began to appear in the 90's and Visual-kei already existed before it.
		Example: [Visual kei] is a [japanese] [movement]

	(2005-01-16 +110/-301)
	A style of Japanese music that really has nothing to do with music. Visual Kei ([VK]) bands are generally rock or indies bands that dress in different types of elaborate  outfits. Many conservatives shy away from VK bands because the men often wear heavy makeup and costumes that make them look like women. Basically VK = crossdressing Japanese rockers.
	
	[Vk] bands dress in a feminine manner but can have many styles. Malice Mizer had more of a romantic/gothic/1800's feel whereas Dir en grey had a more of a slutty, vinyl miniskirts and [thigh-high] [bitch boots] style. Kagrra does more traditional clothing like colorful kimonos and [Psycho le Cemu] is just plain messed up with schoolgirl uniforms and outfits that look like cheap halloween costumes.
	
	VK rockers are generally NOT gay/bisexual. They dress like women to attract record deals, attention, and fans, however, after signing a major record deal and going "mainstream" they usually lose the visual look and become "normal".
		Example: [Dir en grey] used to be a visual kei band [becuase] they dressed like women with heavy makeup, [crazy hair], and feminine clothing.

	(2006-03-08 +99/-705)
	Having [bad music] and trying to [cover] it up with lots of [blush].
		Example: [Who cares]? [Visual Kei] [sucks] sucks.

	(2004-10-04 +89/-642)
	A form of Japanese music that focuses heavily on a very ugly drag queen-esque look. Many [vk] fans may call this "Gothic" and the music "rock". 
	Fans usually are females who love the look of the band members, so they like the music. Many [VK] bands sound the same. 
	Some VK bands are Duel Jewel, [Malice Mizer], Psycho Le Mu, BLOOD. 
	The only good vk band is Dir En Grey, and that's because they no longer look like tranvestites.
		Example: That [38] [year] old woman only likes visual kei because she thinks [the guys] are hot. >:(

	(2006-05-13 +77/-20)
	Literally means "visual type"; from a style/movement in [J-Rock] that started back in the 1980s, and became popular in Japan by the 90s. This style/movement has been largely credited to have been started by [X Japan]; which led to an [uprising] in the trend of the visual scene. It's characterized by bands (namely Japanese) that use dramatic costumes/hair/makeup to basically inhance their visual appearance. Although there are branches of [Jrock], that have different classifications/characteristics that visual-kei. The style alone does not neseccarily have to do with the music; but more alone with its outlandish and unique clothing/hair/makeup-thats what its really known for.
		Example: Many visual-kei bands include: [X Japan], Malice Mizer, Dir en Grey, Gazette, [Phantasmagoria], [Alice Nine], 12012, and many more to name.
		
		

	(2008-02-24 +72/-32)
	Visual Kei or Visual Rock is a genre of rock music in Japan.  A Visual band will usually have a set concept or theme that influences their music style, lyrics, and mode of dress.  
	
	There are many sub-genres of visual kei including [oshare kei] , [kote kei], koteose kei, [soft visual kei], and many more.
		Example: Karen was a [visual kei] band with the [theme] "[life and death]."

	(2011-03-19 +22/-10)
	Visual Kei is a sub-genre of Japanese Music that focuses on self-expression, most Visual Kei, bands do not sound the same, as that statement could be used for Rap as well, but Rap fan will argue that it takes an ear, same applies to Visual Kei. The Key of Visual Kei is too express a message and bring a twist on it. Not all of [VK] fans are female and only care about looks. [The GazettE], one particular VK band has amazingly metaphorical lyrics (if translated). But like all band VK bands talk about a multitude of different themes and should not be dissed as such. Also the 'cross-dressing' comes from their culture which performed (and still does) [Kabuki], a form of theatre where all actors are male, and so if the bands theme requires females, cross-dressing occurs. An example of this is [Versailles] -Philharmonic Quintet- whose theme revolves around two [waring] noble clan set in pre-revolutionary France, with a style similar to speed-metal.
		Example: Visual Kei is just another form of [music] which doesn't want to [conform] to popular music, like [metal]

Visual of Kpop
	(2021-02-02 +182/-3)
	Kim Taehyung aka [BTS V] , a popular member of the [global boy] band BTS.
	
	Kim Taehyungs visuals are often described as National - treasure, unrealistic beauty, an ecstasy, over the top visuals that can't be compared.
	
	Because of his ethereal looks, Kim Taehyung was featured as an artwork at the exhibition 'The [Stratum] of Memory' by Korean artist Shin Shang [Cheol] at 'MOMA Damda' in Yongin city.
	
	Famous illustrator Kildren has mentioned Taehyung as his muse and has created multiple masterpieces of him.
	
	Kim Taehyungs superior visual and his genius talents have earned him the title of "Epitome of Ethereal beauty"

visual novel
	(2006-02-07 +136/-5)
	A Japanese novel read as an game-like application on a computer. A term to distinguish itself from a "Game" because there is usually no gameplay involved, and the only interaction that the player can [make with] the game is making certain choices at specific points in the game that decides which branch of the storyline that the player will take.
	Also distinguishes itself from an "[eroge]" or "[hentai game]" in that sex is usually the main appeal of a hentai game, but plot and story is the main appeal of a visual novel.
	Anime-styled drawing most of the time. Some may contain sex scenes, and some are emotionally charged stories targeted at older audiences with a lot of plot and depth. The pros are that it usually comes with pictures, sounds effects, music and voices which gives one a richer experience than reading a plain novel. [The cons] are that it requires a lot of clicking of [the mouse] to scroll through the novel text.
		Example: Two visual novels, [Kanon] and Air won the best PC game of the year [1999] and 2001 [respectively] in Japan.

	(2019-05-20 +15/-5)
	Fucked-up [visual novel] by Clockup. Clockup makes a lot of fucked up [torture porn] visual novels, but this one is the most well-known and infamous. It also has an anime adaptation, though with less emphasis on the plot and more emphasis on the rape scenes.
	
	The protagonist (if we can call him that) wakes up in a [white room] with six other women, with almost no means of escape except for one. He plays the role as the "key", while the other women are the "keyholes." In order to escape, he must rape each of the girls in a specific way. Refusal to play the game leads to death via electric chair (it's not pretty, trust us).
	
	This game is NOT for the faint of heart or those with a weak stomach. Lots of rape, lots of scat, and one of the characters looks like a prepubescent kid. It's as fucked up as you can get.
		Example: Person A: I only watch REAL anime. My favorite is Euphoria ([visual novel]).
		Person B: You mean the fucked up hentai with all [the rape] and [literal shit]?
		Person A: Yes.
		Person B: You need to get your head checked.

Viszealian
	(2021-03-02 +53/-1)
	Founded by William Francise [Ellingsworth] Jr. in the 1990's as a philosophical religion who understands the holes in quantum physics are filled by means of ("Viszealian") teaching through [quantum entanglement] allowing for faster than light communication or (Simultaneous information sharing) between [all particle] feilds within the Vis'zeal through all levels of consciousness and/or subconsciously communication and does not discriminate between positive or negative emotional displacement of individual idealisms, ego precived distance or time, rather acknowledging the [totality] of everything as one feild that bridges the gaps and binds everything inbetween what otherwise would be considered separation or independence the totality of all where the conventional laws of reality and classical physics are broken and anything conceivable becomes possible as variable calculations of probability are calculated instantly in the [subconscious mind] through quantum entanglement expanding through the field then translated in the form of a desired results to the conscious decision of independent wave function by means of collapse ultimately allowing for the overriding another observations of what is real reprogramming the feild determining one's reality/location within the space-time feild
	
	This is the foundation of Viszealian teaching who's students are chosen extremely carefully and require a certain mentality

	‚Ä¢ he established an indisputable record having organized the [premiere] of his solo concert in the State [Kremlin] Palace on [March 29], 2002. Vitas became the youngest artist who performed a solo concert at the Kremlin.
	
	‚Ä¢ Vitas presented his collection of the clothes "Autumn Dreams" on the stage of the State Kremlin Palace in [September 29], 2002.
	
	‚Ä¢ Vitas got an invitation from [Lucio] [Dalla], the composer, who created "In Memory of [Caruso]", to perform this famous song Vitas together with the author at the concerts "San [Remo] in Moscow" held in the State Kremlin Palace. Vitas‚Äô voice enchanted not only the audience but Mr. Dalla himself. So the composer invited Vitas to come to Rome to take part in the rehearsals of "[Toska]", the modern version of the legendary [opera].
	
	‚Ä¢ Vitas presented his second solo program "The Songs of My Mother" in the Concert Hall "RUSSIA", Moscow in November 2003. Two albums: ‚Äú The Songs of My Mother‚Äù and ‚Äú Mama‚Äù of the artist were released for the premiere. The album ‚Äú The Songs of My Mother‚Äù included the songs which are considered to be the gold reserves of Russian pop-music. And the another album ‚Äú Mama‚Äù included only the new songs composed by Vitas.
	
	‚Ä¢ The Production Center "Pudovkin" organized an unprecedented tour with the program "The Songs of My Mother" in Russia and the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Israel and the [Baltic] States in 2004-2006.

	‚Ä¢ In June, 2006, Vitas was invited by ‚Äú China Central Television‚Äù ([CCTV]) to take part in the grand event of ‚ÄúThe Year of Russia in China‚Äù in Beijing.

	He has a distinct unique style in his songs and music videos. He produces music with a wide range of genres. Notably, his video for "Blessed Guru" has a very eccentric style. He has also made a mark on Russian television.
	
	Vitas' soprano voice has been a very controversial issue in Russian media. It isn't a surprise for anyone in Russia that most pop artists not only hardly ever sing live, but also use someone else's voice (like [Milli Vanilli]). Obviously, Pudovkin and Vitas himself are denying these rumours. In concerts, he makes it pretty obvious that he is not [lip syncing] by moving the microphone away and towards his mouth as he sings.
	
	From 2005, Vitas' MV "Opera#2" has been forwarded frequently by Internet in Asia and Vitas has become popular and famous in Asian market.

	‚Ä¢ According to the Russian Internet portal [AFISHA].COM Vitas is recognized to be an artist among Russian artists in 2004, 2005, who has given the greatest number of concerts on the territory of [Russian Federation], [the Ukraine], [Kazakhstan], [Belarus], the Baltics, Israel.
	
	‚Ä¢ he established an indisputable record having organized the [premiere] of his solo concert in the State [Kremlin] Palace on [March 29], 2002. Vitas became the youngest artist who performed a solo concert at the Kremlin.
	
	‚Ä¢ Vitas presented his collection of the clothes "Autumn Dreams" on the stage of the State Kremlin Palace in [September 29], 2002.
	
	‚Ä¢ Vitas got an invitation from [Lucio] [Dalla], the composer, who created "In Memory of [Caruso]", to perform this famous song Vitas together with the author at the concerts "San [Remo] in Moscow" held in the State Kremlin Palace. Vitas‚Äô voice enchanted not only the audience but Mr. Dalla himself. So the composer invited Vitas to come to Rome to take part in the rehearsals of "[Toska]", the modern version of the legendary [opera].
	
	‚Ä¢ Vitas presented his second solo program "The Songs of My Mother" in the Concert Hall "RUSSIA", Moscow in November 2003. Two albums: ‚Äú The Songs of My Mother‚Äù and ‚Äú Mama‚Äù of the artist were released for the premiere. The album ‚Äú The Songs of My Mother‚Äù included the songs which are considered to be the gold reserves of Russian pop-music. And the another album ‚Äú Mama‚Äù included only the new songs composed by Vitas.
	
	‚Ä¢ The Production Center "Pudovkin" organized an unprecedented tour with the program "The Songs of My Mother" in Russia and the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, Kazakhstan, Israel and the [Baltic] States in 2004-2006.

	‚Ä¢ In June, 2006, Vitas was invited by ‚Äú China Central Television‚Äù ([CCTV]) to take part in the grand event of ‚ÄúThe Year of Russia in China‚Äù in Beijing.

	He has a distinct unique style in his songs and music videos. He produces music with a wide range of genres. Notably, his video for "Blessed Guru" has a very eccentric style. He has also made a mark on Russian television.
	
	Vitas' soprano voice has been a very controversial issue in Russian media. It isn't a surprise for anyone in Russia that most pop artists not only hardly ever sing live, but also use someone else's voice (like [Milli Vanilli]). Obviously, Pudovkin and Vitas himself are denying these rumours. In concerts, he makes it pretty obvious that he is not [lip syncing] by moving the microphone away and towards his mouth as he sings.
	
	From 2005, Vitas' MV "Opera#2" has been forwarded frequently by Internet in Asia and Vitas has become popular and famous in Asian market.

vitiligo
	(2007-06-14 +491/-64)
	[Vitiligo] is a relatively common skin disorder, in which white spots or [patches] appear on [the skin]. These spots are caused by destruction or [weakening] of the [pigment] cells in those areas, resulting in the pigment being destroyed or no longer produced. In most cases, [vitiligo] is believed to be an autoimmune-related disorder. Although researchers
	are not exactly sure what causes the [autoimmune] response, more is being learned every year. In vitiligo, only the color of the skin is affected. The texture and other skin qualities remain normal.
	
	People who develop vitiligo usually first notice white patches or spots (depigmentation) on their skin. [The skin] remains of normal texture, and there is usually no itching or other symptoms. These patches are more obvious in sun-exposed areas, including the hands, feet, arms, legs, face, and lips. Other common areas for white patches to appear are the armpits and groin and around the mouth, eyes, nostrils, [navel], and genitals. Vitiligo generally appears in one of three patterns. In one pattern ([focal] pattern), the depigmentation is limited to one or only a few areas. Some people develop depigmented patches on only one side of their bodies ([segmental] vitiligo). But for most people who have vitiligo, depigmentation occurs on different parts of the body (generalized vitiligo), often similar on each side of the body. In addition to white patches on the skin, some people with vitiligo may experience white hair growing in on the [scalp], eyelashes, eyebrows, and beard. In extremely rare cases, vitiligo can affect eye color or the pigment of the [retina].
	
	Most people with vitiligo have neither parents, nor children, nor siblings with vitiligo. Many have no other relatives with vitiligo. Vitiligo does appear to be [hereditary], that is, it can run in families. Children whose parents have the disorder are more likely to develop vitiligo. There is no question about that. However, most children will not get vitiligo even if a parent has it, and most people with vitiligo do not have a family history of the disorder. So the chances of your child developing vitiligo appear to be very small. Nevertheless, there are sufficient numbers of families where vitiligo does appear among siblings, parents and children, such that we can assume a genetic factor.
	
	The beginning of Vitiligo and the severity of pigment loss differs with each patient. [Light skinned] people usually notice the pigment loss during the summer as the contrast
	between the vitiliginous skin and the suntanned skin becomes distinct. People with [dark skin] may observe the [onset] of Vitiligo at any time. Individuals who have severe cases will lose pigment over their entire body surface. There is no
	way to [predict] how much pigment an individual will lose, Illness and stress can result in more pigment loss. The degree of pigment loss can also vary within each Vitiligo patch, and a border of abnormally dark skin may encircle a patch of depigmented skin.
	
	Vitiligo frequently begins with a rapid loss of pigment which may be followed by a lengthy period when the skin color does not change. Later, the pigment loss may [resume] ‚Äî perhaps after the individual has suffered physical trauma or stress. The loss of color may continue until, for unknown reasons, the process stops. [Cycles] of pigment loss, followed by periods of [stability] may continue [indefinitely]. It is rare for [a patient] with Vitiligo to repigment or [regain] skin color spontaneously. Most patients who say that they no longer have Vitiligo may actually have become depigmented and are no longer bothered by contrasting skin color. While such patients appear to be ‚Äúcured‚Äù, they really are not. People who have Vitiligo all over their bodies do not look like albinos because the color of their hair may not change ‚Äî or it can be dyed ‚Äî and eye color does not change.
	
	Most individuals with Vitiligo are upset because of the [uneven] skin color. It is difficult for those who do not have Vitiligo to appreciate the significance of this problem to the victim.
	
	If a person has Vitiligo over more than half of the exposed areas of the body, he or she is not a candidate for repigmentation. Rather, such a person may want to try depigmentation of the remaining pigmented skin. The drug for depigmentation is monobenzylether of [hydroquinone]. Many patients with Vitiligo are at first [apprehensive] about the idea of depigmentation and [reluctant] to go ahead. However, patients who achieve complete depigmentation are usually satisfied with the end results. Some people become allergic to the medication and must discontinue therapy. This therapy takes [about a year] to complete. The pigment removal is permanent.
	
	[Patches] of vitiligo skin have no natural protection against the sun‚Äôs [rays]. This is because vitiligo skin is white as the melanocytes which produce [melanin] (skin pigment) are [not active]. The effect of the sun is normally to increase melanin production and to turn the skin brown; this is a protective [mechanism] to prevent the skin from being damaged by burning. Therefore, the most important reason for protecting your skin is to prevent [sunburn]. Not only is this painful, but damage to the skin, including sunburn, can stimulate the vitiligo to spread in some people.
	
	Most of the people that suffer from this disease have a hard time with people either not believing them about their condition, or just people giving them a hard time about it, especially when they are African American. 
		Example: [Michael Jackson] is the most famous person who has [Vitiligo]. He was diagnosed in [1984]. Contrary to popular belief, he did not bleach his skin, which is impossible anyway.

	(2007-06-23 +117/-15)
	I have vitiligo.  For some people it doesn't go full blown, leaving many with white-spotted skin contrasting with their normal skin tone.  Fortunately for me, my skin is all the same color, tho i am VERY [fair skinned] now.  Some people give good comments [on my skin] because it is unusual, others can't help being rude and have to point out that i am [so white].  Like i didn't already know.  
		Example: The biggest downside is that i have to remain out of the sun or use extremely protective sunblock. I went to a [baseball game] and forgot my sunblock. I'm not kidding, I [blistered] for 3 weeks!!!  I can burn badly in 45 minutes or less.  [Vitiligo] is more common than you think, and i didn't start getting it until i was 27. I've seen people of every race and color that have it. At first, i was very self conscious about it.  But i've grown used to it and i kinda like that i don't look like everyone else.  I certainly don't look like a freak, just very white-skinned.

Vivo Mexico
	(2005-10-17 +54/-9)
	If you've ever woken up and thought to yourself "i want to chew through a cement block and use a rusty nail to pick my teeth" then you're halfway to understanding the ideal that is [vivo mexico]. A drink, a dip, an invention by minds far greater than mine. In its most simple, physical form it is a 1/2 shot of jose cuervo (regular of especial) tequila and a 1/2 shot of [tostito's] [chunky salsa]. It goes down about as smooth as a handful of glass shards and tastes about as good as a turd wrapped in a kleenex.
	
	But it is more than the drink. [Vivo Mexico] is a mentality required by the man whose BAC is never below .08. To kick a night off with a vivo mexico you either have to have more balls than [the Iceman] [Chuck Lidell] or have down syndrome; and either way you know you're going to have a good time. If by the end of the night you've hidden behind a bush in flight from a giant ogre, pissed in a water fountain, smoked more hookah than the caterpillar in alice in wonderland, were too numb to notice when you put the blunt out on your hand and couldnt get your dick hard enough to have sex with the fatty on the third floor--send out a special thanks to Vivo Mexico. When being a man just isn't enough. Vivo will make you an ultra-man
	
	Note - Invented on the campus of UNC - Chapel Hill
	
	Variations on the vivo mexico shot include
	
	Vivo Mexico Dirty - 1/2 salsa, 1/2 tequila + [whipping cream]
	
	Vivo Mexico Clean - 1/2 salsa, 1/2 tequila + listerine
	
	Vivo Mexico Round 2 - 1/2 salsa, 1/2 tequila + spitting it all up and then drinking it again
	
		Example: [vivo mexico] is [illegal] in [13] countries

	Skyline/import people loath it due to the fact you can put any late model Nissan Skyline engine into it and beat the car the engine came out (R32, [R33], R34 Skylines) of due to the [VL's] lighter body weight.

Vlad The Impaler

	[Vlad Tepes], Prince of Wallachia, was a figure in the Medieval era who has become connected with [the Dracula] legend. Forget bloodsucking, this guy was in to much more hardcore stuff. He impaled friend and foe alike. One he turned back a Turkish army when they saw thousands upon thousands of their comrades dead on wooden stakes. Once, when an [envoy] refused to take off his turban in his presence [Vlad] had it nailed to his head.
	Of course, this didn't help Vlad when the Reaper came knocking for him. Eventually he was killed, by [the Turks] or rebellious [nobles] we cannot be sure. But his head was cut off, preserved in honey to keep it sweet and then stuck on a pole.
	Despite his apparently hideous crimes Vlad was a good ruler. He insisted on total loyalty from his people and his ruthlessness aided him in his war against the Turkish invaders. When first ascending to power one of his first moves was to imprison the treacherous boyars who probably killed his father.

	(2003-08-29 +74/-17)
	The worst piece of shit ever created by MTV.  An excuse for talentless scum like [Justin Timberlake] and [Missy Elliott] to win awards for "Best Music of the Year" while spitting on [Johnny Cash] , and for Metallica to ruin classic songs made by real musicians.  Fuck MTV.
		Example: The only interesting thing about the [MTV] VMAs was when Britney Spears and [Madonna] performed a lesbian-tongue kiss on stage.  The rest of the show was [a fucking joke].

VMI
	(2007-10-09 +600/-177)
	What people would [call Hell]; the Keydets  call home. So go and drink your alcohol, party like there's no tomorrow, sleep half the day, skip class, because when the day is done we can all say this; While you were drinking, I was pushing, While you were partying, I was running, While you were asleep, I was getting [hazed], While you were eating, I was getting screamed at, While you were studying, I was studying harder, While you're complaining, I'm sucking it up, pushing on. But you know what? At the end of the day, when I am exhausted from the abuse I have taken and look ahead with no end in sight, I know that you have enjoyed yourself all this time, and I can accept it. Because I know, I have taken the road less traveled. "Remember rat, [This is the life] you have chosen".
		Example: [George Patton] [left] VMI for westpoint because he wasn't [tough] enough.

	(2005-08-10 +769/-254)
	An institution for real men, that produces such fine alumni as [George C]. Marshall, among others. Other military schools such as the Virginia Tech "Corp of Cadets" and The [Citadel] (aka [Shitadel]) pale in comparison. Who took down Saddam? VMI alumni did.
		Example: "Give me an army of [Citadel] graduates and I'll win a battle, give me a handful of VMI men and I'll win a war." - [Gen]. George S. [Patton]

	(2012-11-22 +142/-51)
	A very small military college in Virginia that: 1) is the only American college to have produced service chiefs for 3 of the 4 primary armed services (West Point, Annapolis and Air Force have not done this); 2) has produced 7 Medal of Honor winners and more than 70 Distinguished Service Cross/Navy Cross/Air Force Cross winners -- a number exceeded by only 2 of the 5 service academies; 3) has produced more Rhodes Scholars per graduate than any state supported school in the U.S.; 4) produced America's top Army general in WWII (who is also the only career soldier ever to win the Nobel Peace Prize) ; and 5) is the only college in the U.S. (including the service academies and the New England schools) to have produced a five star general, an Academy Award winner, a [Supreme Court Justice], a [Pulitzer Prize] winner and a Nobel Peace Prize winner. It has 1500 students. [Pound for pound], schools like Army, Navy, Harvard and Yale (and very small handful of others) have done more for our country, but when it comes to producing a unique and badly needed quality of leader, VMI has few peers.
		Example: VMI is a classic military college where all students live as cadets 24/7. [Cadet] life is similar to that at [the Citadel] and the [service] academies.

	(2006-11-28 +515/-225)
	VMI...The Nation's ONLY state military college. This is a non-disputable fact. All other "state military colleges" (ie. Norwich, Texas A&M, [Citadel], Va Tech Corps of Cadets, etc.) have civilian students and cadets at the school. Imagine how "cheezy" it would be to ask a [West Point], VMI, Navy, Air Force, or even [Coast Guard] graduate, "Were you ever a cadet?" Next time you see another state "military" school grad talking about how tough their "hard-core" school is, ask if he or she was in the cadet corps or in the day, night, undergrad, or grad civilian program!! 
	
		Example: The unfortunate souls who have spoken negatively about VMI need to check the facts on how many medal of honor recipients, Marine Corps Commandants, rhodes scholars, and general officers (including the most four-stars and a [five-star] general) the little tough military college in Virginia has produced... all other "state military schools" [pale in comparison]. Check the endowment figures while you're at it. And for the [poor sap] who talked about the "loser in the bar not being in the real military," remember this after you compare all the facts, the Army Colonel who commanded the raid that captured Saddam Hussein was a VMI graduate. By the way, get a life and try not to slander the most prestigious state military college in our country. 
		

	(2011-01-02 +128/-513)
	Very mediocre institute. A place where [JROTC] idiots who could not get into the academies go. They think they are hardcore when in fact they under perform Virginia Tech in almost every [ROTC] department. They are so completely consumed by their own [hype up] they fail to realize that they cannot connect with normal people because they are such epic tools with no social skills that could not lead a herd of cows to graze much less a military unit of any kind. Their called "Keydets" how ridiculous does that sound.
		Example: VMI [Keydet]: I'M FROM VMI AND I'M AWESOME!!!
		
		Va Tech Cadet (or any other [ROTC] for that matter): [HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA] look at this little kid, what a joke! get a life.

	(2010-03-24 +120/-483)
	Virginia Metalwork [Institute]. A school for cadets who didn't make it into [West Point]. Produces an unusually high number of fail-outs who may go on to long and [prosperous] careers as shop teachers, metal workers, and faggots.

	(2015-07-21 +132/-221)
	A purring or [rasp] in the lower register of the voice, particularly at the trailing end of a word or sentence. [Vocal fry] had been around for a long time without attracting criticism (go listen to [Billie Holiday]), until someone decided there were too many women's voices in the media, and needed some excuse to criticize them without appearing sexist. Now [vocal fry] is one of the most egregious of sins. Men can have vocal fry too, but will never be called out on it.
		Example: "I can [barely] stand to listen to that [newscaster's] vocal fry. How did she ever get [hired]?"

		Girl 2: [Yeahhhhh].... She was totally cuuutttteeeee.......
		Girl 1: I love the way she [speaks]. Like Vocal Fry is the bestttt.....

vocal weight
	(2011-07-09 +73/-16)
	In opera, vocal weight is a term used to describe how "light" or how "heavy" that a voice is and by extension what kind of roles that it is suited to.
	
	Lighter voices are associated with [lyric] voices while heavier voices are associated with dramatic voices; lyric voices are usually brighter, sweeter, and more agile while dramatic voices are usually powerful, rich, and darker than their lyric counterparts.
	
	[Spinto] voices, usually limited to tenors and sopranos, are a kind of bridge between lyric and dramatic voices, "light [heavyweights]" in a manner of speaking.
		Example: [Vocal weight] may or may not be obvious immediately; a singer needs a number of opinions before any determination is reached. Vocal weight is also a strong mark of who gets to sing what in opera. Lyric voices usually play more vulnerable characters while dramatic voices usually play bold, strong characters.
		
		Lyric voices are strong, but they're light; they don't like to sing very loudly very often and often sound forced when they do so. Lyric voices are designed for smooth, sweet singing, agile passages and clear diction.
		
		Dramatic voices are bigger and heavier than lyric voices and their power makes them more difficult to maneuver through flowery [coloratura] passages, but dramatic voices are designed to sing loudly; they can sing over a large orchestra more easily than lyric voices can and are filled with emotion in addition to power.
		
		[Spinto] voices are light but powerful and are essentially lyric voices with a strong dramatic edge ([squillo], or "ping"), which allows them to cut through a full orchestra (rather than sing over it like a true [dramatic voice]).

	The best form of music ever. A Fusion of beautiful trance, with angelic vocals.
	
	Better than all that Black [R'n'B] crap the majority of the world listens to. 
	
	Vocal Trance is looked down upon by some people, but they cannot appreciate true, awesome music, and would rather listen to that stupid [Black shit] that every other moron listens to.
	
	Also notice how people who listen to Vocal Trance type correctly, unlike the ones "[hu] [typ] lyk [diz] lolz"
	
	Point: Proven
		Example: I was listening [Aylin] - Viva The Love, and was taken into a total [dream world]. Then some fag told me his gay [Twista] and Usher music was better, so I smashed him in the face and walked off.

Vocaloid
	(2010-07-09 +468/-56)
	Vocaloid is a singing synthesis software created by Yamaha. Standing for "Vocal Android" it is a computer program which you can use various singing voices to create songs. Each voice is provided by a "[seiyuu]" or voice actor, and then named and given [box art]. The first Vocaloids were "Leon" and "Lola" created by Zero-G who sing in English. Then they also released Mirium. After this the first Japanese Vocaloid was released, "Meiko". After this "Kaito" was released, the first Japanese male. Vocaloid 2 was the updated version of the program, and the first voice released was "[Sweet Ann]" by PowerFX. Crypton, another Japanese company then released "Hatsune Miku", who is now the most popular and well known Vocaloid. Vocaloids later released by Crypton, in order of release are "[Kagamine Rin] and Len" and "[Megurine Luka]". Various other notable Vocaloids by different companies are "Gackpoid", "Megpoid", "Prima", "Hiyama Kiyoteru", "[Kaai Yuki]","SF-A2 Miki", "[Sonika]" and "Big Al". An update for "Hatsune Miku" was later released, named "Hatsune Miku Append". This contained 6 human-like voices suited to different genres. The other Crypton Vocaloids are also scheduled for Appends. Vocaloid 3 has been confirmed, and will be the most realistic sounding program yet.
		Example: I love "Vocaloid". [Hatsune Miku] FTW.
		Yeah, she's so awesome! I like the one where she spins the [leek]!
		Oh, you mean Ieven Polkka? Yeah that's good. I like [Love is War] more though

	(2011-08-30 +115/-18)
	Vocaloid is a computer software developed by the Yamaha Corporation, famous for its musical software, motorcycles, and pianos. Vocaloid is intended to be used for the purpose of creating songs, as it is a singing synthesizer. To use, one [inputs] a melody and lyrics into a pianoroll interface, [selects] the voice(s) they would like to sing the song (i.e. the famous [Hatsune Miku]), and selects the 'Play' function of the software. There are currently 25 released Vocaloids, which can sing in English and Japanese, and in a short matter of time, in Chinese, Korean, and Spanish. Vocaloid is usually either loved (by fans of [J-pop] and anime) or detested (by those who are not J-pop or anime fans). The most popular are Hatsune Miku and [Kagamine Rin]/Len. Users of Vocaloid to create original songs are commonly referred to as "Producers". Notable "Producers" are 'Akuno-P/mothy', whose complex stories bring a tear to one's eye, 'Owata-P', who makes viewers laugh with his silly songs, and 'Machigeriita-P', who has successfully given Vocaloid lovers [the chills] with his horror-filled masterpieces.
		Example: Honestly, Vocaloid is a truly fickle thing: one moment, you hear Megpoid: [Gumi] singing about time travel (Time-Warped By Chopping My [Stag Beetle]; I kid you not, that is the song's real name), and the next about committing double suicide with her boyfriend ([Sunset Love] Suicide)! Guess it depends on the producer, though.

	(2009-07-06 +412/-155)
	An extremely awesome music-making software. It has countless characters to choose from with different voices. They sing best with Japanese, probably because their origins come from Nico Nico Douga. The pack includes some that aren't Vocaloids but still are included, like [Kasane Teto], and remade [Miku Hatsune's], like Haku, Teto, and [Neru].
	
	Vocaloid is a well-known Japanese meme, probably because of their uniqueness, their ability to sing anything, even English songs.
	
	Vocaloid is a software that you have to pay and know Japanese kanji. The yen/dollars needed to buy the software is very expensive.
		Example: My favorite song that is sung by Vocaloid is [Triple Baka], which is sung by Miku Hatsune, [Teto] Kasane, and [Neru].

	(2012-01-14 +92/-36)
	A popular voice mimicking software originally made by [Yamaha], though development has been took over by Crypton Future Media. One types in sounds and a 'voicebank' (recording of a human of all sounds in different pitches) will sing it. There is a multitude of these voicebanks for it including the renowned 'Hatsune Miku'
	
	[Hatsune Miku] is a hugely popular 'virtual diva' made for the Vocaloid 2 software, she has a [high voice] and she has received complaints about being inhumanly high. The Hatsune Miku [append] was created adding a number of added voices of different [tones]/emotions to make for better songs. She is receiving an English update for Vocaloid 3, and is looking to be promising as of now.
	
	There is many other, and in my opinion better voicebanks, but that doesn't mean some people who claim to be Vocaloid fans actually have never heard of any other than [Miku].
		Example: *At Voca-con*
		Vocaloid Poser: Are you actually a Vocaloid?
		
		Me: I'm [Kagamine Len]! I'm hugely popular D:<.
		Vocaloid Poser: Never heard of him, (lo, he's so obviously lying... poser).
		
		*Next year*
		Vocaloid Poser: Who are you?
		Me: I'm a male Vocaloid called Utatane [Piko].
		Vocaloid Poser: Lol, [Hatsune Miku] is the only Vocaloid, idiot...

	(2010-03-16 +16/-0)

	(2017-03-07 +63/-9)

		Example: "Hey, have you heard that one [Vocaloid] song by [Rin] and [Len]? Electric Angel, I think it was called?"

	a computer remixing and voice editing program, in which one is supplied with different [seiyuu], or voice actors. one shall proceed to type the melody and lyric of a song, and upon pressing play, hear that character sing the chosen song. there are many different vocaloids, but the most common is the first... hatsune miku, literally meaning 'voice of the future' 
	she dons bright [blue pig] tails, a super tiny mini skirt, arm [warmers], and flings a [leek]. there is much of vocaloid on youtube and nico video. 
		Example: I love to listen to vocaloid remixes! they sound [so nice]. 
		
		My favorite on vocaloid is vocaloid [meiko]. [I love her] voice!

		As I grew up my body didn‚Äôt and it was difficult being so small, people would try to be sexually involved with me except I couldn‚Äôt handle it so I decided to not be in relationships by being [voluntarily] [celibate].
		
		Years ago I realized that I don‚Äôt like people, I don‚Äôt see any person as attractive so I refuse to get intimate with anyone so I am a voluntary celibate. #VoCel

vocoder
	(2005-07-15 +98/-15)
	A vocoder is a sound effect that can make a human voice sound synthetic. It is often used to speak like a robot, with a metallic and [monotonous] voice.
	To put it simple: whenever you speak, your voice consists of two components. The first component is your basic voice type, produced by your vocal chords. It varies in pitch but remains nearly constant in type and is quite unique. That's why you can distinguish between persons when you hear their voices. The second component is how you [modulate] the basic voice. [Modulation] means that you dynamically [amplify] and attenuate frequencies. This is done by the mouth and tongue when you speak.
	
	The benefit of doing this is, you can make the carrier speak or sing. As a side effect, the formant's voice type is absolutely irrelevant to the output so everybody (even those with an ugly voice) can create cool and futuristic samples.
	
	If you want to hear good examples of it's usage, listen to a few songs from [Zapp] & Roger/Roger [Troutman].
		Example: The group [Zapp] & Roger was known for producing funk music while using the vocoder. The popular song "[More Bounce to the Ounce]" has been [sampled] into many hip-hop artist's songs.

	(2003-06-21 +1271/-381)
	Vodka is a clear, colorless, unaged liquor "made from [ethyl] alcohol from agricultural origin". It was originally made in Russia from potatoes, but today's vodka, which is almost odorless and tasteless, is usually made from grain, primarily barley and wheat, and occationally from rye.
	
	Vodka is integral to many cocktails such as [the Screwdriver], Bloody Mary and [Vodka Martini]. If served straight, it should always be icy-cold.
	
	Flavored vodkas have become popular in the United States and may be flavored with anything from fruits to hot peppers. Some flavored vodkas are even sweetened slightly.
	
	
		Example: 

	(2005-05-17 +671/-249)
	[Russian Water]. Very good without anything except bread (dont [eat bread], it costs to much, just sniff) fine [dinning].
		Example: Ya [Tosha] Gavoru Pa [Ruski]. [Mudak]

	(2005-04-30 +205/-106)
	A drink that can be either complete shit or damn fine. Has one of the most delicate tastes if properly [filtered]. [Quartz] filtered vodka recomended over a [charcoal] filter

		or
		
		I had a bottle of [Smirnoff] [vodka and] I couldn't touch the shit. Couldn't even use that to make a fuckin' cocktail!!

	(2006-01-13 +434/-302)
	Unfortunately it has become a pop culture joke. Most popular vodkas (smirnoff, [absolut]) are absolut shit and made in Sweden or Finland or something. Real and good vodka must be made in a slavic country. There is an ongoing argument with Poland and Russia over who created the drink.

Vogon
	(2004-09-21 +247/-78)
	Here's what to do if you want to get a lift from a Vogon: Forget it. They are one of the most unpleasant races in the galaxy. Not actually evil, but bad tempered, bureaucratic, officious and callous. They wouldn't even lift a finger to save their own grandmothers from the [Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal] without orders signed in triplicate, sent in, sent back, queried, lost, found, subjected to public enquiry, lost again, and finally buried in soft peat for three months and recycled as firelighters. The best way to get a drink out of a Vogon is stick your finger down his throat, and the best way to irritate him is to feed his grandmother to the [ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal]. 
	
	[Vogon poetry] is of course, the third worst in the universe. The second worst is that of the Asgoths of Crea. During a recitation by their poetmaster [Grunthos] the Flatulent of his poem "Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in my Armpit One Midsummer Morning" four of his audience died of internal haemorrhaging and the president of the mid-galactic Arts Knobbling Council survived only by gnawing one of his own legs off. Grunthos was reported to have been "disappointed" by the poem's reception, and was about to embark on a reading of his 12-book epic entitled "My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles" when his own major intestine, in a desperate attempt to save humanity, leapt straight up through his neck and throttled his brain. The very worst poetry of all perished along with its creator, Paul Neil Milne Johnstone of Redbridge, in the destruction of the planet Earth. Vogon poetry is mild by comparison.
		Example: Oh freddled [gruntbuggly], 
		Thy micturations are to me 
		As plurdled gabbleblotchits 
		On a lurgid bee. 
		Groop, I implore thee, my [foonting] turlingdromes 
		And hooptiously drangle me 
		with crinkly bindlewurdles, 
		Or I will rend thee in the [gobberwarts] with my blurglecruncheon 
		See if I don't.

	(2007-11-17 +258/-161)
	Main villain in the popular children's series, Harry Potter.
	
	Born [Tom Marvolo Riddle], he was raised in an orphanage after his mother died during his birth, and the father, a muggle (non magical person) wanted nothing to do with him, his family, or his mother.  Described as being a very handsome young man resembling his father, and remained that way up until his later years (thirties to forties) 
	
	Even at a very young age, he was shown to have control and a little bit of skill with his magic.  Is also seen as a bit psycotic even during his pre pubescent years, and thinks that Dumbledore is a doctor coming to take him away.  
	
	During school, he was sorted into Slytherin. He was very, very gifted, and even won  the 'special services to the school' for getting rid of the man who opened [the chamber of secrets] (this is later found out to be false, and he in fact opened the chamber.)  He was [head boy] during his seventh year.  Directly after graduation, he applies for a job teaching at Hogwarts, but Headmaster Armando [Dippet] turns him down, saying that at eighteen he is too young. He then goes to work for [Borgin] and Burkes instead.  
	
	Around ten years later, he reapplies as Defense Against  the Dark Arts teacher, but headmaster Albus Dumbledore refuses.  The job has been cursed ever since, with each teacher not staying more then a year.
	
	He then began to gather followers who believed in his ideology of pure bloodwizards being superior, and that half bloods, (which in fact he was one) muggle [born's], and muggles, were not worthy of living.  His followers called themselves [Death eaters], and they are marked with a skull and snake burned into there forearm.  It is known in at least one case with devoted and only female follower, [Bellatrix] Lestrangenee Black, that Voldemort himself taught and trained her in the dark arts.  It is unknown whether or not he did this with any other follower.  Some fans of the series say that he and Bellatrix were a romantic item, and author JK Rowling said that in fact, Bellatrix "truly loved Voldemort".  It is unknown weather or not he returned those feelings.
	
	At the height of his power, he heard of a prophecy, saying that a boy born in the end of July would be his downfall.  It is then that he went to the [Potters] and attempted to kill the main protagonist of the story, Harry Potter.  However, the curse [rebounded], and left Voldemort in a state a little better then death.  
	
	Eleven years later, he inhabited a man named Professor Quirrell in attempt to steal the Philosophers stone (Sorcerers stone in the American and film version) in order to regain his former strength. He was thwarted, however by Harry, and when Professor Quirrell was killed, he left the body without the stone 
	
	One year after that, his diary from school was given to Ginny Weasley, a first year and sister [to Harry's] best friend Ron Weasley, by [Lucius Malfoy].  It was unknown to Lucius that the diary was a [horcrux], a magical item in which a [dark wizard] puts a piece of his soul.   It  inhabited Ginny and forced her to open [the Chamber of Secrets] and attempt to murder several Muggle born wizards.  Later in the film, Harry, Ron, and DADA professor at the time, Professor [Lockhart], went down in to the chamber and whale Ron looked after Lockhart (he had cast a powerful memory charm on himself), Harry fought not only the [Basilisk], but a teenage Voldemort.  After he killed the Basilisk, he used one of the fangs to stab the diary, 'killing' it in a sense.
	
	Two years later, Voldemorts loyal servant [Wormtail], (who betrayed the Potters) brings Voldemort back to life,  using Harry's blood, Voldemorts fathers bone, and his own hand. [The potion] works, and Voldemort returned.  He then called his followers, a majority of which return to him.  Voldemort fights Harry, and a strange thins happens in the midst of there battle.  When they cast a spell at the same time, there wands connect, and Voldemorts wand 'regurgitated' the spells he last cast.  Harry sees his mother, father, and Cedric, a boy killed by Voldemort just minutes before, and they tell him what to do.  When they tell him to break the connection, Harry does, grabs [Cedric's] body, and the [Triwizard] cup (a port key that brought Harry to the dueling spot) and he goes back to Hogwarts, leaving Voldemort angry, and at full power.
	
	One year later, he breaks his most faithful out of Azkiban,  a wizarding prison, and then orders them to go to the Hall of mysteries and steal the Prophecy containing him and Harry.  He has also begun invading Harry's mind,  using fake images of his [god father], Sirius Black being tortured by him at the hall.  Harry along with several of his friends go to the hall of Mysteries, believing that the images are true.  A battle insures, in which the prophecy smashes, and Bellatrix kills Sirius (her cousin) and Harry for the first time uses a unforgivable curse.  It is ineffective however, as he didn't really want to torture her, and was just angry.    She refuses to believe it is broken until Voldemort himself shows up and tells her that Harry is not lying.  She begs for mercy, but he ignores it.  Soon after, Dumbledore shows up and begins dueling with Voldemort.  They are both equally matched, and for a mere second, it appears that Dumbledore  has won.  However, Voldemort inhabits the body of Harry and  quotes the headmaster, saying that "if death was nothing, then why not kill the boy?" He leaves soon after however, grabs Bellatrix, and gets spotted by the minister of magic.  
	
	One year later, he is at the height of his power, using the [Malfoy manor] as headquarters, and is scared for the first time of Harry finding out about his horcruxes.  He has taken over the ministry, and attempted to kill Harry while he was traveling to safety to a member of the Order of the Phoenix, a group dedicated to defeating Voldemort.  However, [Harry's wand] acted on its own accord and shot a spell directly at Voldemort.  He is afraid for his horcruxes, but is positive that he would have felt  it if they got destroyed.  In any case he keeps his snake Nigini, a snake where he kept another part of his soul, close at hand.  He discovers that Harry stole his [locket], another horcrux, and in turns destroys it.  He also discovers that Dumbledore destroyed                                    his ring (another horcrux.)  Later in the book, Harry, Ron, and Hermione (disguised as Bellatrix) break into [Bellatrix's] vault and steal [Helga Hufflepuff's] cup, another horcrux.  When he finds out, he is very, very angry and goes on a killing spree in Gringotts, leaving only Bellatrix and Lucius alive (they scampered before he had a chance to kill them, and in my opinion, he [wouldn't of] killed them, both being very high up in his inner circle.) He then goes to Hogwarts, where [the golden trio] goes to attempt to destroy the cup and find the last horcrux. They succeed and all the [Horcrux's] left now are Harry himself, and Nigini.  A battle insists, where  his followers all fight the supporters of Hogwarts.  He calls them off, saying that if Harry gives himself up, then  he will give them mercy.  They have one hour.  He then goes and hides in the [forbidden forest] with the surviving [death eaters].  Harry comes to him eventually, after seeing the memory of Snape after Voldemort kills him in order to have control of [the Elder wand], a wand that can not be beaten if someone takes it from there current master. Having [Snape killed Dumbledore] (the last holder of the wand) Voldemort assumes that Snape is the true master, unaware that the death of Dumbledore was planned by Dumbledore himself and Snape two years before hand.  He is unaware that Draco Malfoy, the wizard who [disarmed] Dumbledore, is in fact the real master of the wand.  But then Harry disarms Draco while captured in there mannor, making Harry the master of the wand.  After Harry sees the memory in which Dumbledore tells Snape that Harry must be killed by Voldemort in order to defeat him, he goes to him.  Voldemort then kills him, knocking himself out in the process.  He is unaware that when he tried to kill him years ago, he made Harry a horcrux. Harry does not die, but Voldemort is told by [Narcissa Malfoy] that he is however, wanting to enter the castle and save her son.  They go into the army, and Voldemort falsely tells them that Harry is dead.  Fighting continues however, and eventually the only people left fighting for him is Voldemort himself and Bellatrix.  Bellatrix is murdered by [Molly Weasley], and Voldemort is very angry and attempts to kill Molly.  Harry then reveals that he is alive, and he protects Molly.  They circle each other for a few [minute's], Harry telling Voldemort that he is the true master of his wand, and reveling that Snape was [Dumbledore's] man.  Voldemort shoots the killing curse at Harry, the same time that Harry also shoots a spell. The spell rebounds, and Voldemort is finally killed once and for all, never to return.

voldo
	(2006-02-27 +191/-53)
	A character of the [Soul Calibur] series that has existed in all of the Soul Calibur games created so far. He wields a pair of Indian weapons known as katars that act as extensions of his hands. He lives as an eternal guardian in an underground [sanctum] known as the money pit, which houses the treasure of his deceased master who he vowed allegiance to, [the merchant] of death; Vercci. after living in the dark completely isolated from the world, [Voldo] became blind and eventually forgot his own name and language. after a while he begins to hear the voice of his master Vercci who told him to seek out the sword [soul edge].....
	
	Voldo is considered by [soul calibur] fanatics to be an upper-mid tier character. This means that he can be extremely powerful if used correctly. 
	
	Voldo doesn't really [falter] in any particular area of combat. He has powerful throws, horizontal and vertical attacks, and his attack speed is fast. He is VERY unpredictable, and if youre playing against an experienced player, then you will learn to hate Voldo for how annoying he can become. For example, if [voldo] is used correctly, you may never get to hit him, and it is very easy to do this with Voldo because most of his moves are fast execution, which is a good thing because, for example, if you attack an enemy with a fast execution move and your opponent guards it, you will be able to recover quickly and guard the attack he throws [back at you].
	
	Most people don't pick Voldo as a character if they are fairly new because of how creepy he is. I mean seriously, he is one of the only characters to wear a thong (Ivy is the other) he is blind, he forgot his own name and speaks no words, only [groans] and hisses. His weirdness goes into his moves though too. One of his stances is called [the Mantis] Crawl, where he holds himself off of the ground, suspended by all four limbs and walks around like a spider. He can also attack backwards during his blind stance, which is extremely useful because you dont have to worry about being defenseless while you have your back to your enemy. Another note is that Voldo is one of two characters ([Astaroth] is the other) who can [negate] a back throw. Very useful.
	
	Like I said, most people don't use Voldo because he is creepy and if your friend sees you use Voldo you will have to convince him that you're not gay. Of course, the simple way to do this is to kick the [living hell] out of your friend with Voldo.
	
	
		Example: New Player- Who are you gonna pick? I'm gonna be [Siegfried] because he is masculine and has a ridiculously large sword that can chop you in two like he was slicing butter. 
		
		Experienced Player- Oh Im gonna be [Voldo]
		
		New Player- HAHHHAHAHAHA [VOLDO]???? he is such a gay character! he wears a freakn thong! im gonna kill you so easily and--
		
		Video Game Voice----Voldo wins!
		
		Experienced Player- A blind guy in a thong definitely knows his business....

	(2006-01-22 +48/-37)
	[Voldo] is a character popularized by the soul blade/ [soul calibur] video game series. He uses two blades that are [extensions] of his hands sometimes called katars. He dominates pretty hard even though he looks really weird.

They are even the producer the iconic Beetle and the stereotype inducing Jetta. In addition, they invented and still rule the Hot [Hatchback] category with the Golf [GTI]. Their engines are easy to work on, last forever and will run for at least 350,000 miles. Though they have a reputation for smaller things breaking, the overall quality and build [solidity] is exceptionally high. Parts are shared between Audi and Porsche, as they are all one company. This gives [VWs] the feel of much more expensive cars and has resulted in a large following of VW fans around the globe, similar to BMW or Jeep.

	Sadly, lots of people don't buy VW because Hitler possibly thought up the idea or they just plain out don't like Germans.

		Thou shall speak of Volkswagen several times daily and of a positive manner.
		
		Thou shall enjoy [the daily] task involved in maintaining and clean one's Volkswagen.
		
		Thou shall take interest in Germany. Interest in it's people and it's culture.
		
		Thou shall spread the good [gospel] of Volkswagen, being of fine quality and dependability, to the [blind man].
		
		Thou shall learn, and take into study, [Volkswagen's] history.
		
		Thou shall stand up for the values and beliefs of Volkswagen - of company, employees, owners, and of the fellow Volkswagenist.
		
		Thou shall never pass another Volkswagen in distress. Love thy brother of both water and air.
		
		Thou shall try to make one [pilgrimage] to Wolfsburg in one's life. By one's self or of representation.

		It is important to remember that air [cooled] and water cooled children are of the same father, Volkswagen. Do not make borders between each. We must travel with and among each other in harmony. To become a true Volkswagenist one should follow these commandments of life. On the road of life, there are owners and there are followers.

Time and time again, they've continued to find success with both younger and older generations, instilling a sense of family and comradrie in the drivers, similar to that found in Jeep owners. Most Volkswagen owners who take their cars seriously gain valuable insight into the world of German engineering, tweaking the lines of their cars to both increase their overall performance and retain an impressive and distinct style at the same time.
		Example: I just picked up an [R32]... and blew the [unpainted] [body kit] off of a 1991 Civic that attempted to race me.

Their engines are easy to work on, last forever and will run for at least 350,000 miles. Though they have a reputation for smaller things breaking, the overall quality and build [solidity] is exceptionally high. Parts are shared between Audi and Porsche, as they are all one company. This gives [VWs] the feel of much more expensive cars and has resulted in a large following of VW fans around the globe, similar to BMW or Jeep.
		Example: Dude, I [juts] got my new Volkswagen [GTI], it's [really fucking awesome]. I don't think I'll buy anything else ever again.

	(2005-04-13 +256/-164)

	[VolksWagen], sometimes shortformed into VW, [Volks]/VolksW or VWagen is a type of car from Germany, started somewhere in the 1930's or so. It's believed that the idea of VW was thought up by Hitler, then when a Nazi heard, he liked the idea and started it.
	[Volkswagen] translates into "People Car" or "The People Car" in German. 
	
	Sadly, lots of people don't buy VW because Hitler possibly thought up the idea or they just plain out don't like Germans. 
	
	But, that's kinda stupid. [German engineering] is really good, and it lasts and long time (Hence you see lots of old VW around) 
	
	The most known VW models are: 
	Beetle
	Rabbit 
	Golf 
	Jetta 
	Karmann-Ghia 
		Example: "Bob just bought a [Volkswagen beetle]" 
		"Volkswagen is [German]"
		"Jane hates Volkswagen. She doesn't know [a thing] about good cars, though."

	[Voltron] is one of the key, [flagship] shows that defined Anime as we know it today in America.  It was a popular show back in the early to mid 1980's.  One of the difinign characteristics of the show is that all of the individual lions could join together and create Voltron (the large form which was comprised of each individual lion).  Today it has two meanings, and they are as follows:
	1. (noun); A cartoon made in Japan that helped to define and carve a niche [in America's] anime stable.
	2. (verb); To combine forces together to attain a common goal.  
		Example: Dave:  "I'm such a noob, I just don't know if I'll be able to finish today's [crossword] [puzzle]."
		Adam:  "Well if you like, since Chris is the only one who has completed it thus far, perhaps [you and I] could voltron our answers in hopes of finishing it as well."

	-vampire [mobsters]
	-run by three brothers; [aro], marcus, and [caius]
	-people who do the dirty work: jane, alec, felix...
	-italian vampires
	
		Example: oh crap! i forgot to change bella into a vampire! now the [volturi] are going to send jane, [alec], and the others for me! i guess the saying "'sleeping' with [the fishies]" won't exactly apply to me...

	(2011-08-31 +20/-19)
	The Volturi are a group of ancient italian vampires that protect vampire law. In other words make sure the existence of vampires stay secret. The Volturi [Coven] includes [Aro], [Caius], Marcus, [Sulpicia], and Athenodora. And [Didyme] used to but Aro killed her because he was too power hungry to let Marcus and her leave the Volturi. There's also The Volturi Guard. That consists of Alec, Jane, Felix, [Demetri], Chelsea, [Renata] (partial). Basically they do all the REAL work. Aro, Marcus, and Caius aren't kick-ass enough to do much so they have others to do their bidding. In short Alec, Jane, Felix, and Demetri do pretty much everything and sometimes consult with Aro. In modern times (via Breaking Dawn) Aro has become tired of Plan A: Keep the existence of vampires a secret to Plan B: Take over the vampire world in power hungry in greedy ways.
		Example: Felix: Some n00bish vampires in England are creating an army
		[Aro]: Perhaps we should take care of that.
		Jane: Suppose we should to that.
		
		*Jane, Alec, Demetri, and Felix go but a stop to (kill) the n00bish vampires meanwhile Aro, Marcus, [Caius] "leaders of the [volturi]" sit on their butts*

	(2010-01-30 +45/-18)
	Alec [Volturi] is a fictional character from Stephenie Meyer's The Twilight Saga. He first appeared in New Moon. He is Jane's twin brother. Together, the twins became the most [offensive weapon] of the Volturi.
	
	Alec is mostly described to be the nice twin but he's actually not. He works quietly and keeps to himself, studying every attack of the enemy, analyzing on when to give out his attack. Among the family and the guards, he is the least apathetic of them all. He's kind of animated in some way, as the books says, he was the one who teased Jane and Edward in New Moon. I noticed also that he was smiling most of the time in [Chapter 21], Verdict. Alec has very dark brown hair, lips less full as his sister's and the same red eyes like the rest of human blood-drinking vampires. He looks gorgeous indeed and will make every girl drop dead at the sight of him. Alec has the common abilities a vampire has, speed, strength, und so [weiter]. His gift though, is extremely powerful. While her sister induces pain and can only concentrate on one person, his gift is the exact opposite, the antidote. His special ability is to cut off one's senses and he can also do this to a multiple number of people. This power is in the form a misty gray haze.
	
	In the book it was said that Alec and Jane looked like 13 year olds, but in the movie, they were portrayed by [Cameron Bright], then 16, and [Dakota Fanning], 15...
		Example: -A normal scenario from school-
		Guy#1: Hey, who's that Alec Volturi guy on your page?
		Me: My husband. Duh.
		Guy#2: *raises his eyebrows* Eh? Where's he from?
		Me: Italy. Duh.
		Guy#1: Duh, what book?
		Me: OH! [New Moon] :->
		Guy#1: Ahh...
		Me: [8-]>8->8-> COOL! YOU'RE INTESRESTED!
		
		______________
		
		Oh My Alec Volturi! Curse your gorgeousness :((
		______________
		
		You're Alec Volturi, [Renesmee's] husband right? :->
		______________
		
		Alec Volturi, marry me.

	(2010-01-30 +26/-20)
	...Also, the books stated nothing about his love life. That lead people like me to think of everything turns out with him...and we came with a preposterous answer: Renesmee Carlie Swan Cullen. Yes, Renesmee, the impossible child, the daughter of [THE Edward Cullen] and Bella Swan. The one that the DOG :[o3] loves...but sucks for him, Team Reneslec existed >:)
	In the world of Twilight, Jacob might be Paris and Edward [the Romeo], but in the Reneslec world, Jacob is the Romeo, Alec is Paris...AND WE ARE TEAM PARIS!

voluntaryism
	(2014-07-09 +71/-4)
	[Voluntaryism] is the belief that all interaction should be voluntary and, by necessity, free of external [coercion]. It is heavily related to te NAP due to it's rejection of initiating force against others while still allowing for defensive actions.
	
	Another key aspect to [voluntaryism] is self ownership: each individual owns him/herself and is therefore responsible for their own actions. Furthermore, no person or group has any legitimate claim to excersizing control over, or otherwise placing restraints on, the actions of others so long as the person's actions do not violate the [equal rights] of others.

volvo driver
	(2005-06-03 +868/-450)
	[Volvo drivers] are people who value quality and safety over [ostentation]. They are often liberal, well educated, and upper middle class. Although the cars are pricey to buy and maintain, Volvo drivers see them as works of art--well-made machinery that protects their passengers, other drivers, and even pedestrians from the [hazards] of the road. Volvo drivers appreciate the cars' understated comfort and the [manufacturer's] concern for the environment. Even so, Volvo drivers have become easy targets for disparagement among those who think that a car that isn't flashy isn't worth owning or who envy the financial means of those who can afford them. Phrases like "tree-hugging, latte-sipping, Volvo-driving liberal elitists" seek to belittle people who care about their safety, their environment, and the value of Scandinavian engineering. An important point is that [Volvos] are not yuppie cars. Yuppies like flashier, head-turning cars that announce their owners' wealth. Volvos are preppy cars, generally favored by suburban WASPs, although the [S40] is popular with younger, urban drivers. Like their drivers, Volvos are conservative and understated. If the cars are well cared for, they can last forever, so [Tripp] can drive Daddy's 10-year-old Volvo off to college.

	[Volvo drivers] are people who value quality and safety over [ostentation]. They are often liberal, well educated, and upper middle class. Although the cars are pricey to buy and maintain, Volvo drivers see them as works of art--well-made machinery that protects their passengers, other drivers, and even pedestrians from the [hazards] of the road. Volvo drivers appreciate the cars' understated comfort and the [manufacturer's] concern for the environment. Even so, Volvo drivers have become easy targets for disparagement among those who think that a car that isn't flashy isn't worth owning or who envy the financial means of those who can afford them. Phrases like "tree-hugging, latte-sipping, Volvo-driving liberal elitists" seek to belittle people who care about their safety, their environment, and the value of Scandinavian engineering. An important point is that [Volvos] are not yuppie cars. Yuppies like flashier, head-turning cars that announce their owners' wealth. Volvos are preppy cars, generally favored by suburban WASPs, although the [S40] is popular with younger, urban drivers. Like their drivers, Volvos are conservative and understated.

vore
	(2006-03-30 +5832/-783)
	Short for "[voraphilia]" or "vorarephilia": a fetish in which one fantasizes about being eaten alive or eating another creature alive (sometimes known as phagophilia). The most common type of vore is "soft vore", being swallowed or swallowing whole with no bloodshed. There is also the less common "[hard vore]" which involves the tearing and chewing of flesh. Other types of vore include [macrophilia] and [microphilia], in which one character involved in the vore is larger or smaller than normal. 
	
	Many might associate vore with cannibalism; however, most voraphiles do not favor cannibalism. Vore is an imaginary fetish; that is, it is impossible to perform in real life in the way most fantasize, unlike most cannibalism.
	
	Also included with vore is sometimes the "furry" community: people who are interested in usually anthromorphic animals (humanized creatures). With animals as characters in vore fantasies, predation is natural and therefore somewhat more realistic.
		Example: He [drew] pictures of a people being [swallowed] whole by [wolves] for other voraphiles on a vore site.

	(2009-03-09 +808/-168)
	1. vore (n) pl. vore: The original definition of this term was a nickname for [vorarephilia] (hint: often misspelled vorephilia or voreaphilia), derived from Latin "vorare," meaning "to devour" or "to swallow," and from Ancient Greek "[philia]," meaning "love" or "friend." The actual word "vorarephilia" itself refers to a [paraphilia] closely related to [endosomatophilia], a paraphilia in which one derives sexual pleasure from being consumed or covered by anything, but vorarephilia is different in that the particular person deriving the sexual pleasure may be either an observer, a victim, or a predator, not just a victim, and in that the act must be or is preferably between two creatures who are at least remotely alive. It is sometimes (but not necessarily) consensual. There are various subsets, but the most common form is referred to as "soft vore," in which one of the two participants is swallowed whole and alive by the other. This fantasy may but does not always include [digestion]. The current definition of the term "vore" is usually used to refer to this paraphilia, but is sometimes used to describe any small online community of individuals who [depict] the content of this paraphilia with some other emotion behind the work besides sexual motivation, i.e. humor or depression. Though uncommon, such individuals and their communities undeniably exist (unless you don't believe in existence itself, or you think that everyone in the world is tricking you and is really [out to get] you, or anything like that).

	[Vore] is a sexual fetish that is not widely known about as of the date this definition was wrote, that revolves around the general concept of taking pleasure from being eaten, or eating. Which can include animals, food, or any other sort of eating or being eaten. but for the most part [vore] would be used to describe the fetish of the person eating another person or the person being eaten and enjoying it. There are [two kinds] of Vore.
	
	Soft Vore: Soft vore defines all kinds of vore that do not involve killing gore [digestion] [etcetera]. usually swallowing the victim alive whereby [the predator] holds them ''prisoner'' [for lack of a better word]. actually doing this kind of soft vore is, as you could have easily reasoned impossible in real life and often is released online in the form of roleplaying, and sometimes other fashions
	
	[Hard vore]: Basically [cannibalism]. [hard vore] is like soft vore, except it can and often will involve digestion, death, and very realistic features. any more information unfortunately cant come from me because ive never looked into hard vore more then what it is about. Hard vore is theoretically possible incase it lacks certain things that would happen in real life, such the victim being swallowed whole, but technicly it is possible in the form of cannibalism.
	
	There are also mixtures in between, sometimes vore is mixed in with sex but because of lack of understanding ill leave the reader to come up with what that could be, which is hard to understand incase you are one of the people. Some people litterally find vore pleasing, but have no interest in sex like [i am living] proof of. Preferences in vore vary GREATLY and it cannot be [narrowed] down into a simpler subject without encountering errors.
	
	Vore often involves alot of imagination. including very commonly the body having elastic like stretchability as to contain the victim without harming him or her.
	
	Vore is not related to in any way the [unbirth] fetish, or [rebirth] although it could be half-wittedly argued, but such an argument would be like watching star wars and then saying, "Hey wasnt [mofasa] good in that movie?" and then when your friends point out that mofasa was never in the movie you say "Well he could have been." its possible, but its not only improbable but ridiculous to argue since there is not a single stable fact supporting it. 
	
	Usually vore is a noun, but it can be used as a slang verb or adjetive or whatever just like most nouns
	However sometimes people who like vore also like unbirth or rebith, it is simply a coincidence sort of like wether they like vore and sex or only one. although there is the possibility though its hard or me to understand, that a sexual point of view might be the cause of people liking both.
		Example: Hey, have you ever been to [eka's] portal? its a community site all about vore of [all kinds].
		
		Hey would you like to roleplay some vore? ill be [the prey].
		
		You know i love vore.
		
		Wanna have vore? -example of slang verb

	the act of [eating someone] [whilst] they are [still alive]
		Example: i did vore on [francais]

	(2011-06-25 +92/-60)
	Fetish. Short for [voraphilia] which means to derive sexual arousal from performing, viewing, or receiving the [mastication] of and by an animate being/person; [cannibalism]. It is exclusively - with the exception of some underground communities - seen only in art and story form, where more difficult and impossible situations can be portrayed and shared safely within the [Vore] fetish community
	
	[Soft core] Vore - involves swallowing a being whole, or just placing said being in the mouth. Involves no blood shed. The victim is often portrayed as a willing participant, though not always.
	Hard core Vore - blood, bones, body parts, chewing, cooking, resistance
	Size Vore - Where victim, viewer or eater are abnormally tiny or gigantic
	
	Other forms of [vore] include...
	
	Penis Vore - an entire being is placed or seen within the shaft, foreskin, or [urethral] opening of the penis.
	Vaginal Vore - an entire being is placed or seen within the vulva or the vagina.
	[Anal Vore] - an entire being is placed or seen within the rectum or bowels.
	Pregnancy Vore - an entire being seen inside the belly of another being with distension as to appear that the latter is pregnant with the former by way of Soft core Vore, Anal Vore, Vaginal Vore or Penis Vore.
	
	Appropriate reference is made to the Furry (humanized animal) fetish since the act of eating other animals is one part of the Furry [allure]. Most vore fetishists are into Furry; however, not all Furries are into vore.
		Example: "Did you think it was hot when the [Audrey II] tried to eat Audrey I and had her in it's mouth?"
		"....um no. Gross."
		"Really?... I always did"
		"You're into [Vore]? WEIRD!"
		
		Customer: "can you put the camera very close to your mouth?"
		[Cam model]: "like this?"
		customer: "now tell me you will eat me"
		Cam model: "I WILL EAT YOU, YOU CRAZY [VORE] LOVIN MOTHER ..CKER"

	(2006-03-30 +5832/-783)
	Short for "[voraphilia]" or "vorarephilia": a fetish in which one fantasizes about being eaten alive or eating another creature alive (sometimes known as phagophilia). The most common type of vore is "soft vore", being swallowed or swallowing whole with no bloodshed. There is also the less common "[hard vore]" which involves the tearing and chewing of flesh. Other types of vore include [macrophilia] and [microphilia], in which one character involved in the vore is larger or smaller than normal. 
	
	Many might associate vore with cannibalism; however, most voraphiles do not favor cannibalism. Vore is an imaginary fetish; that is, it is impossible to perform in real life in the way most fantasize, unlike most cannibalism.
	
	Also included with vore is sometimes the "furry" community: people who are interested in usually anthromorphic animals (humanized creatures). With animals as characters in vore fantasies, predation is natural and therefore somewhat more realistic.
		Example: He [drew] pictures of a people being [swallowed] whole by [wolves] for other voraphiles on a vore site.

	1. vore (n) pl. vore: The original definition of this term was a nickname for [vorarephilia] (hint: often misspelled vorephilia or voreaphilia), derived from Latin "vorare," meaning "to devour" or "to swallow," and from Ancient Greek "[philia]," meaning "love" or "friend." The actual word "vorarephilia" itself refers to a [paraphilia] closely related to [endosomatophilia], a paraphilia in which one derives sexual pleasure from being consumed or covered by anything, but vorarephilia is different in that the particular person deriving the sexual pleasure may be either an observer, a victim, or a predator, not just a victim, and in that the act must be or is preferably between two creatures who are at least remotely alive. It is sometimes (but not necessarily) consensual. There are various subsets, but the most common form is referred to as "soft vore," in which one of the two participants is swallowed whole and alive by the other. This fantasy may but does not always include [digestion]. The current definition of the term "vore" is usually used to refer to this paraphilia, but is sometimes used to describe any small online community of individuals who [depict] the content of this paraphilia with some other emotion behind the work besides sexual motivation, i.e. humor or depression. Though uncommon, such individuals and their communities undeniably exist (unless you don't believe in existence itself, or you think that everyone in the world is tricking you and is really [out to get] you, or anything like that).

	Short for "[voraphilia]" or "vorarephilia": a fetish in which one fantasizes about being eaten alive or eating another creature alive (sometimes known as phagophilia). The most common type of vore is "soft vore", being swallowed or swallowing whole with no bloodshed. There is also the less common "[hard vore]" which involves the tearing and chewing of flesh. Other types of vore include [macrophilia] and [microphilia], in which one character involved in the vore is larger or smaller than normal. 
	
	Many might associate vore with cannibalism; however, most voraphiles do not favor cannibalism. Vore is an imaginary fetish; that is, it is impossible to perform in real life in the way most fantasize, unlike most cannibalism.
	
	Also included with vore is sometimes the "furry" community: people who are interested in usually anthromorphic animals (humanized creatures). With animals as characters in vore fantasies, predation is natural and therefore somewhat more realistic.

	1. vore (n) pl. vore: The original definition of this term was a nickname for [vorarephilia] (hint: often misspelled vorephilia or voreaphilia), derived from Latin "vorare," meaning "to devour" or "to swallow," and from Ancient Greek "[philia]," meaning "love" or "friend." The actual word "vorarephilia" itself refers to a [paraphilia] closely related to [endosomatophilia], a paraphilia in which one derives sexual pleasure from being consumed or covered by anything, but vorarephilia is different in that the particular person deriving the sexual pleasure may be either an observer, a victim, or a predator, not just a victim, and in that the act must be or is preferably between two creatures who are at least remotely alive. It is sometimes (but not necessarily) consensual. There are various subsets, but the most common form is referred to as "soft vore," in which one of the two participants is swallowed whole and alive by the other. This fantasy may but does not always include [digestion]. The current definition of the term "vore" is usually used to refer to this paraphilia, but is sometimes used to describe any small online community of individuals who [depict] the content of this paraphilia with some other emotion behind the work besides sexual motivation, i.e. humor or depression. Though uncommon, such individuals and their communities undeniably exist (unless you don't believe in existence itself, or you think that everyone in the world is tricking you and is really [out to get] you, or anything like that).
	
	2. vore (n) pl. vores: Any individual or group of individuals who are driven to any extent by the concept stated above.
	
	3. vore (v) (past tense is [-ed] form, such as "walked" or "[lumped]"): To participate as [the predator] in the activity stated in definition 1. Not usually used with anything real as the subject or any of the objects (in a real situation, and often even in an imaginary situation, the verb "eat" is the more obvious choice).
		Example: Definition 1 example: "Warning: this picture contains vore."

	[Vore] is a sexual fetish that is not widely known about as of the date this definition was wrote, that revolves around the general concept of taking pleasure from being eaten, or eating. Which can include animals, food, or any other sort of eating or being eaten. but for the most part [vore] would be used to describe the fetish of the person eating another person or the person being eaten and enjoying it. There are [two kinds] of Vore.
	
	Soft Vore: Soft vore defines all kinds of vore that do not involve killing gore [digestion] [etcetera]. usually swallowing the victim alive whereby [the predator] holds them ''prisoner'' [for lack of a better word]. actually doing this kind of soft vore is, as you could have easily reasoned impossible in real life and often is released online in the form of roleplaying, and sometimes other fashions
	
	[Hard vore]: Basically [cannibalism]. [hard vore] is like soft vore, except it can and often will involve digestion, death, and very realistic features. any more information unfortunately cant come from me because ive never looked into hard vore more then what it is about. Hard vore is theoretically possible incase it lacks certain things that would happen in real life, such the victim being swallowed whole, but technicly it is possible in the form of cannibalism.
	
	There are also mixtures in between, sometimes vore is mixed in with sex but because of lack of understanding ill leave the reader to come up with what that could be, which is hard to understand incase you are one of the people. Some people litterally find vore pleasing, but have no interest in sex like [i am living] proof of. Preferences in vore vary GREATLY and it cannot be [narrowed] down into a simpler subject without encountering errors.
	
	Vore often involves alot of imagination. including very commonly the body having elastic like stretchability as to contain the victim without harming him or her.
	
	Vore is not related to in any way the [unbirth] fetish, or [rebirth] although it could be half-wittedly argued, but such an argument would be like watching star wars and then saying, "Hey wasnt [mofasa] good in that movie?" and then when your friends point out that mofasa was never in the movie you say "Well he could have been." its possible, but its not only improbable but ridiculous to argue since there is not a single stable fact supporting it. 
	
	Usually vore is a noun, but it can be used as a slang verb or adjetive or whatever just like most nouns
	However sometimes people who like vore also like unbirth or rebith, it is simply a coincidence sort of like wether they like vore and sex or only one. although there is the possibility though its hard or me to understand, that a sexual point of view might be the cause of people liking both.
		Example: Hey, have you ever been to [eka's] portal? its a community site all about vore of [all kinds].
		
		Hey would you like to roleplay some vore? ill be [the prey].
		
		You know i love vore.

vorpal
	(2004-01-31 +280/-54)
	An adjective originating in [Lewis Carroll's] "Jabberwocky" poem in <i>[Through the Looking Glass] and What Alice Saw There</i>.  Due to his description of it, most generally would agree that it deals with slashing damage severing a limb or head; however, it can be stretched to mean any form of weapon that can possibly kill in one blow, considering the word itself is a "nonsense word" created by Carroll.  Despite its popularity and history, it still eludes [a normal dictionary].
		Example: I don't [allow] my characters to have vorpal [weapons]; they are simply too [powerful].

	(2008-02-09 +225/-46)
	(VOR-pl) or, [seldomly], (VOR-puhl)
	
	-adjective
	
	1) Infinitely sharp; possessing an edge (or tip) of zero [thickness].
	
	-adjective (slang)
	
	2) Tending, or possessing a tendency, to [decapitate]. (slang)
	
	----------------
	
	-= Usage and Etymology =-
	
	In RPGs (role-playing games, such as [Dungeons & Dragons] and the Final Fantasy series), "vorpal" is an adjective describing and referring to a [bladed] (slashing) weapon that has been magically enchanted in order to [imbue] it with an edge that is infinitely sharp (or, significantly rarer, a similarly-imbued pointed (stabbing) weapon with an infinitely sharp tip).  The result of a vorpal [enchantment], which is achieved foremost through the casting of a magic spell by a sufficiently powerful mage (a wizard or [enchanter], for example), is the melding of the actual edge of the (almost always) metal blade with the addition of a new, extended edge, which is not only composed of a substance of a magical and nearly [impervious] nature, but, as the outer limit of the new magical edge is approached, decreases in thickness until the two sides meet at what is literally a mathematical line of zero thickness.  Such [a blade] is, in reality, obviously impossible, due to the fact that, the nonexistence of magic considered, the size of the particles that matter is made up of are, although very small, most certainly nonzero.
	
	There are no degrees of vorpality; it is an absolute.  [A blade] is either vorpal, or it is not.  Additionally, and perhaps counterintuitively, a blade can be vorpal regardless of its angle.  The numerical degree value of [the angle] of a [vorpal blade] can be (and, for the greatest effectiveness in battle, almost always is) very small, but it is entirely possible for the angle to be very large, including, technically, even angles in excess of 180¬∞ (although such constructs are never seen due to the lack of practical application for something with such an enchantment on an angle of that magnitude, atleast in comparison to the time, resources, and skill required to vorpalize an object); the only relevant factor is that the [edge's] angle can be viewed and will subsequently appear identical at any [magnification] whatsoever, without the edge ever losing integrity or becoming rounded off, a condition that, at sufficiently small scales, the laws of physics dictate any real blade (or, even in the realm of fantasy, any nonvorpal blade) must succumb to.
	
	There are, in addition to blades (and the odd [stiletto] or arrow or [chakram]), other possible forms for vorpal objects.  While there is seldom compelling reason in an RPG to [expend] the ordinarily exorbitant effort and resources necessary for the vorpalization process on objects other than weapons, or atleast something that will be used for cutting, any object at all that has an edge or a point can be vorpalized.  Ordinary metalworking means, for instance, can be used to fashion a highly accurate one-foot cube of metal.  Iron, gold, [mithril]; the type of metal is not important.  Using magic, a wizard can turn a one-foot cube of iron into a one-foot vorpal cube of iron.  What does that mean exactly, and what will the result be?  While the faces of [the cube] will remain mostly unaffected, the vorpalization process will fill in any gaps and imperfections along the edges and corners, and the wizard will have a cube of iron that is not only reinforced along its edges with a virtually impenetrable magical material, but is completely and accurately one cubic foot in size.  Not accurate in size to within a trillionth of a trillionth of an inch, but accurate in size to mathematical perfection.
	
	----------------
	
	-= Origin =-
	
	1871, [Lewis Carroll]; coined in and for, and used on line nine of, the poem "[Jabberwocky]" (found both as a separate work of literature, and also as a part of [Carroll's] novel, "Through the Looking-Glass, and What Alice Found There")
	
	----------------
	
	-= Related Forms =-
	
	vorpality: (vor-PAL-uh-dee) - (noun): the state of being vorpal
	vorpalize: (VOR-puh-lize) - (verb): to make vorpal; to imbue with vorpality
	vorpalization: (VOR-puh-luh-ZAY'-shin) - (noun): the process of making vorpal
	devorpalize: (de-VOR-puh-lize) - (verb): to remove or reverse a vorpal enchantment
	nonvorpal: (NON-vor-pl) - (adjective): possessing finite sharpness; not vorpal
		Example: Occurrences of "vorpal" are most often found in the weapon descriptions in RPGs, some of them played in person with a board, such as [Dungeons & Dragons], and others requiring a video interface, both single-player and multi-player, online  and offline.
		
		To give a lengthy example, including all of the details pertaining to the setting in which something vorpal is introduced to players, the following description is how the word would be used in the context of an in-person, board-and-dice role-playing game like Dungeons & Dragons:
		
		"As the [phylactery] disintegrates, a sudden, horrible scream fills the room around you, and then, much more slowly than it appeared, fades off into the distance until the hallway is overwhelmed by silence.  The chest you have traveled so far for now lays at your feet, unguarded and vulnerable for the first time in its existence, while [all that remains] of [the lich] who formerly owned your newfound treasure is a few bone chips and strands of hair, and a tattered and singed [royal blue] robe, half-draped over the steel box.
		
		After checking the chest for traps, you waste no time in opening it, only but a crack at first.  As you lift the lid the tiniest amount, a [white light], small but perceptible, spills out from behind the cracks and allows your next quick glances around the room to bring you to realize just how dark the room had been earlier. 
		
		Opening the chest fully, it is not the hoard of platinum pieces that catches your attention, nor is it the jewels scattered among them.  What your eyes are immediately drawn to is the [hilt] of a sword, buried in the treasure up to the [chappe].  The [pommel] and crossguard have been constructed of a bluish-purple material that, in the lighting available, you cannot at first identify.  You grab the sword by the grip, an unusually soft leather from the feel, and slowly withdraw it from under the mass of coins.  As you do, you notice something most bizarre.
		
		Not only does the blade have not a single scratch or imperfection on it, or atleast any visible to the naked eye, but along both edges, to various depths and in different locations and directions, the blade is embedded in half a dozen platinum coins, cut through them as if they had been made of butter.
		
		A light reflects off of the hilt, and your gaze is averted there once again.  What looked at first to be a dull [cobalt], you can now see is a brilliant [iridescent].  As you turn the hilt this way and that, the [blue and purple] swim and swirl together with a small cloud of green, and you recognize it instantly.  The crossguard and pommel have been fashioned out of the scales of a [rainbow dragon], and an ancient [wyrm] at that, judging from the intense, luminous radiance of the hue.  Your attention turns back to the [skewered] platinum coins, one of which slides off the blade as you turn it again and falls to the ground, spinning and circling your foot for a second or two before falling flat to the floor.  Something in your head clicks as you realize what it is you have found.
		
		There can be no mistake.  You have discovered a vorpal sword."

	(2002-11-28 +74/-62)
	1. An adj. meaning extremely sharp, usually so sharp as to [cut through] anything without any resistance whatsoever.
	
	2. A specific [enchantment] upon a magical sword that, on a [crit], severs the head of its victim automatically.
		Example: 1. [I swear to God], [dad's] [turkey] knife is vorpal or something.
		
		2. My vorpal longsword +2 made quick work of those Amnizu enforcers.

	(2003-03-06 +33/-28)
	[adj]. Infinitly [sharp].  So sharp it cannot be measured.

	(2005-01-20 +477/-70)
	An attempt to scare people into voting. [Spoofed] hilariously on "South Park" when Stan refused to participate in the latest voting dispute between a liberal-minded giant douche and a conservative-minded [turd sandwich], which resulted in him being chased all over town by gun-weilding hoods led by [P.Diddy].
		Example: Vote or die motherfucker
		Motherfucker vote or die
		[Rock the vote] or else I‚Äôm gonna stick a knife through your eye
		
		Democracy is founded on one simple rule
		Get out there and vote or I will motherfucking kill you
		
		I like it when you vote, bitch
		Shake them titties when you vote, bitch
		I‚Äôll slam my jimmy through your mouth roof
		Now [get your big] ass in the [polling] booth
		
		I said vote bitch or I‚Äôll fucking kill you
		
		Vote or die motherfucker
		Motherfucker vote or die
		Can‚Äôt run from a .38, go ahead and try.
		
		Let your opinion be heard
		You‚Äôve gotta make a choice
		Cause after I slit your throat
		You won‚Äôt have a fucking voice
		
		Vote or Die
		Vote or Die

	(2005-01-19 +113/-32)
	Quite possibly the stupidest [publicity stunt] ever attempted, all masked behind "good intentions". This was a campaign slogan used by Sean "[P. Diddy]" [Combs] in the 2004 election, most likely in an attempt to look cool or "badass", but just ended up making an ass of himself.
		Example: "[VOTE] OR DIE!" was a dumb [campaign] [slogan].

	(2004-11-03 +434/-160)
	1. A crappy [publicity stunt] spearheaded by P. Diddy to call even more attention to himself.
	
	2. A campaign to get more 18-24 year olds off their booties and down to the [polling] place.  This campaign features all of the latest celebrities this generation worships because they can't think for themselves.  
	
	3. An attempt to recruit [new Democrats].
		Example: 1.  [Farnsworth] [Bently] is getting more spotlight then me.  Let me push this VOTE OR DIE campaign off on the MTV generation.  Plus, it will be free publicity- just in time for Making The Band 3, which airs next season.
		
		2. Since college age kids don't give a crap about this nation's politics, let's have celebrities tell them to vote. 
		
		3.  Since the word Republican is synonomous w/good ole' boys, and other wealthy, racist, undersireables, most of the new voters will have to register & vote Democrat.  It's not like they will take the time to see what the [Green Party] or the Libertarians have to offer.

	New York (AP) - Music/[Fashion mogul] Sean "P. Diddy" Combs may be a suspect in a series of violent murders, in which of the victims were all un-registered voters, or registered voters who did not participate in the 2004 Elections. All six victims were killed in the same manner, with a single [gunshot to the head]. Police believe these murders are a direct response to the "warning" Combs has made repeatedly during the past few months; "Vote or Die". While many saw the "Vote or Die" campaign as being simply an innapropriately-named event, it now seems possible that Combs was fully serious in his words, and that he is now carrying out his promise. While Combs is currently not a suspect, the police have not ruled out his involvement completely. Combs' publicist was unavailable for comment at this time.
		Example: Actually, this never happened. "[Vote] or [Die]!" is still a pretty stupid name for a [campaign], though.

	(2004-12-31 +47/-37)
	[Glorified] [voter intimidation]/[publicity stunt].
		Example: That [so-called] "rapper" [Puffy] will stop at nothing to keep his name in [the papers].

	(2010-11-02 +100/-12)

	(2007-01-22 +32/-33)
	Voters are responsible for deciding the outcome of basically any election, except for instances like the the 2000 [presidential election] between Al Gore and George W. Bush, when the people of the United States cast a [plurality] of the votes for the looser.  There are many factors that contribute to whether or not a person is likely to vote and, if they do, who they will vote for.  The elderly and the well-educated are more likely to vote than the uneducated and the youth, meaning that the people viewing this website are about the least likely people in the world to vote.  Wealthy [evangelicals] are more likely to vote Republican, for instance, while college graduates and minorities are more likely to vote Democrat.  It is likely that the people reading this definition are liberal just because they are on Urbandictionary and therefore could contribute to the Democratic cause, but are [probly] too lazy or young to vote and would rather jusst wine about the issues and hope the magically get fixed.
		Example: The [voters] hold [the fates] of our lives in their hands.  I hope they [arn't] retarded and vote for someone better than Bush.

Now unemployed and receiving healthcare through the state exchanges created under the [Affordable Care Act] he plans to vote for a president who wants to take away his healthcare.

	(2016-02-01 +1030/-27)
	A [devious] plot in which Republicans try to prevent those who are likely to support the [Democratic]
	
	party from voting. Usual [targets] are African Americans, the poor, and the elderly.

	(2017-03-21 +341/-12)
	This is [the new] 'politically correct' [replacement] for 'retard' that we have all been [waiting] for!

	People who have neither partisan nor ideological conviction at any detectible level. Most often found in the suburbs, these voters are often swayed by emotional appeals rather than philosophical, moral, or logical arguments. As such, these voters are [emotionally torn] pulled the two parties ‚Äì they want to vote Republican as they live what they believe to be the capitalist dream of a comfortable, two-income, and sterile life in the ‚Äòburbs (with the perception of being inoculated from those sticky urban social issues), at the same time they want to vote Democrat to [assuage] their guilt of their own mindless and unconscious lifestyle (such as talking racial tolerance but living in a racially [homogeneous] community, expressing horror at things like [outsourcing] jobs while drawing a paycheck from a company that does it every day, driving gas-guzzling SUVs while claiming their concern for the environment, and outwardly claiming support for their neighborhood public school systems while sending their own kids to private school). Often claiming to be independent, they criticize [partisans] on both sides for being closed-minded while believing there is nobility in their own indecision.
		Example: More and more people are swing [voters] and we wonder why no one votes ([hint]: if you don‚Äôt have [the stones] to decide where you stand, then either candidate, or even a non-vote, will do)

	(2016-11-11 +295/-23)

Voter fraud
	(2016-08-24 +81/-6)
	Call me a [nitpicky] [fuckerfish], but you guys are wrong. Voter fraud is when the voter cheats, not the candidate, that's called [election fraud], or electoral fraud!

	A strategy in which Republicans are trying to prevent people who might [oppose] them from voting, typically the poor, elderly and minorities. Usually they will claim they are just trying to stop [voter fraud] even though [there is no evidence] that that has been a problem
		Example: In Texas as part of their Voter Suppression program a concealled carry [permit] can be used as an ID to vote, but a [student ID] from one of their state colleges does not count, it's pretty obvious who they're trying to stop from [voting].

voting
	(2005-10-25 +174/-25)
	In an election, the process whereby elegible citizens submit their choice for the person/party who gets to exploit them for the next 3-4years. People will often get wildly enthusiastic about which dishonest piece of crap they're going to "vote" for this time around, completely forgetting their previous experiences with politicians, which [resembled] nothing so much as being simultaneously [mugged], insulted and [assraped]. If voting could change things, it would be illegal.

		Candidate: And will you be voting for me today, sir?

	(2004-11-03 +86/-33)

	-A process in which, if you don't participate, you are considered [unpatriotic], lazy, ignorant, apathetic, and morally unsound despite the fact that voting for a candidate isn't a black or white issue.
	-an illusion of [power to the people]
	-something that Chingy, Puff Daddy, Christina Aguilera tell you it's imperative to do (but don't do themselves), and by not telling for whom you should vote they've rendered their arguments inane.

		b-WHAT? it's your duty to vote!
		a-How is it my right and my duty at the same time?
		b-if you don't vote you have no [right to complain]
		a-last time I checked, if you don't vote for a candidate you have every right to complain if they mess up!
		b-You need to get out there and vote...make a difference!
		[a-Okay], who should I vote for?
		[b-I'm] not going to make that choice for you...vote for who you want, but get out there and vote.
		a-If it's imperative for me to vote then you must tell me for whom I should vote. If it doesn't matter who I vote for then it doesn't matter if I vote. Voting itself has no inherent value. Ignorant and apathetic nonvoters are better than ignorant and apathetic voters!

	(2004-04-22 +218/-153)
	In a system in which you have no real input, this act of casting a [ballot] is worse than a waste of time - it legitimates the system of power which has [excluded] you from real decision [making in] the first place.

		Example: Debating on what could be possibly be the most useless way to spend his time, he eventually decided to pause [Gigli] and go voting.
		
		Candidate1: "Good thing everyones out there Voting, now i can get that blumpkin I deserve! By the way, [the campaign] manager wants to know when you're going to return those clothes? You look like a [Blingleberry].

	(2011-04-22 +121/-24)
	[An act] performed when over the [age] of [18]
		Example: I'm 18 and legal by the way

		You've never elected anyone before? I can tell you what I know!

		Kurt - Kurt, I'm going to vote - oh god I'm voting!
		OH MY GOD [I LOVE DEMOCRACY]!

	(2004-11-07 +5497/-2043)
	The best way you have of voicing your opinion in a way that can matter.  [Nothing's] perfect, and there's always going to be mistakes, but there is simply no excuse for not casting a [ballot] for what you believe in.  Take the time to understand the issues and then take the time to vote.  Don't let people who aren't going to be around four years from now decide your future. Complaining without voting is worse than any [hanging chad].
		Example: My [conscience] is [clear] because I took the time to vote.
		
		Don't worry about [rocking] the vote, just vote!

	(2020-10-22 +36/-9)
	If it is 2020 and you're an American adult reading this, then vote, [you fucking bitch]. Over [100 million] people didn't vote in [the 2016 election]. This election is fucking important, do it.

	(2007-12-29 +281/-162)
	[Voulez-vous coucher avec moi] (ce soir)? is a version of a French phrase that has become well-known in the English-speaking world through popular songs. It means "Do you want to sleep with me (tonight)?" and is perhaps best known from the song "Lady Marmalade," written by the songwriting team of Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan and first popularized in 1975 by the group Labelle featuring Patti LaBelle, Nona [Hendryx] and Sarah Dash. The song was rerecorded by Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, M√Ωa, and Pink as a single for the Moulin Rouge! film soundtrack. This phrase also appears in Tennessee [Williams's] 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire. David Frizzell and Shelly West recorded a country music song in the 1980s called "[Voulez-Vous Coucher Avec Moi]" that was unrelated to "Lady Marmalade".
	
	The origins of the phrase in English, however, can be traced back to a poem by E. E. Cummings published in 1922 and known by its first line "little ladies more", which contains the phrase "[voulez-vous coucher avec moi]?" twice.
	
		Example: The phrase [Voulez-vous coucher avec moi] ce soir is also in the song, "It's Me Bitches" (Remix) by Lil Wayne, R-Kelly, and [Swizz Beatz].
		
		The lyrics can also be found on the track "Get Out Of My House" by Dead or Alive, on their album Nude and also on the track "Nasty Naughty Boy" by Christina Aguilera, on her album Back to Basics.
		
		Voulez-Vous is the title of an album and its title track by ABBA and a cover of the track by the A*Teens.
		
		The first single of the German duo S.E.X. Appeal is named " Voulez-vous coucher avec moi"
		
		This phrase is used in the South Park episode "[Make Love, Not Warcraft]" by Eric Cartman addressing Clyde (after Cartman asks Clyde if he is French, to which Clyde says no).
		
		The phrase is used by the ostensible villain of the film Better Off Dead.
		
		The phrase is also in the song "Doctor Monroe" by Casey Dienel.
		
		The phrase is part of the song Voulez-Vous Danser by Ace of Base, on their album "Sign", released in 1993.
		
		Chris Tucker says the phrase as he makes out with a French girl (Genvieve) in Rush Hour 3.
		

	(2003-08-12 +142/-169)
	[It's in] French, It means: [Would you like to] [have sex with me] tonight?
		Example: 

	(2004-03-09 +86/-165)
	French, taken from [the pop] song. It virtually means "Will you bed with me tonight?" and is a [lousy] [pick-up line] at the best of times.
		Example: "So, [Sweetcakes], [voulez-vous coucher avec moi], [ce soir]?"
		
		"Hell no, and stop drooling on my frock"

	(2004-04-15 +56/-168)
	french: literally voulez means to want, [vous] is you, [coucher] put to bed, avec moi is with me, [ce soir] is tonite
		Example: Want you [put to] [bed] with tonight
		is what it [literally] means, but it's saying basically will u f*(k me tonight

	(2006-04-19 +293/-129)
	The phrase "[Voulez-vous coucher avec moi]?" actually appeared before the song, in the play "A [Streetcar] Named Desire" by Tennessee Williams, and a poem by [E.E. Cummings]. The phrase is puzzling as it uses formal language ("vous" is the formal way to say "you") while describing an intimate act (the phrase literally means "Do you want to come to bed with me?"). This leads many to believe that the phrase is tied with prostitution.
		Example: "[Voulez-vous coucher avec moi ce soir]?" is the formal way of saying "Would you like to come to bed with me this evening", as opposed to the informal "Veux-tu [coucher] [avex] moi".

	(2005-04-24 +144/-63)
	Actually, "Lady Marmalade" was not by [Patti Labelle], but by the group Labelle, a band she fronted.  Nona [Hendryx] and Sarah Dash rounded out the trio.  "Lady Marmalade" was written by Bob Crewe and Kenny Nolan and was featured on [Labelle's] 1974 album Nightbirds.

	(2021-07-12 +12/-4)
	VPS (VultraPrivateServer) is one of the three powerful GDPSs, notable for its large power and disdain for [CnekGDPS]. Being one of the most interesting GDPSs in terms of history, it is a taboo subject and feels [distanced] from the more mainstream side of the [GDPS] community. It has an isolated community that takes a long time accepted into, but this is most likely because of the more hidden aspects of VPS.
	
	VPS is not a GDPS, rather a reflection of [Vultra's] personality. Any opinions, actions, or thoughts that come from [Vultra] get [amplified] and broadcasted by the community. Ignoring whether I agree with these opinions or not, VPS is most likely so distanced because it is a tool, rather than a true GDPS.
	
	VPS is often exaggerated by CnekGDPS, truly it is much less extreme and much less of a pain than the community of CnekGDPS makes it out to be. The cynical nature of [CnekGDPS's] community combined with the "troubled" past they have with VPS has caused a warped view of reality that prevents them from seeing any good in VPS. My own opinions are definitely opposed with VPS, although they serve a necessary role in the GDPS community as one of the three powerful GDPSs.
		Example: Have [you heard] of [that one] [homophobic] VPS member?

		Example: Vsco girl

	(2019-08-01 +2938/-479)
	Type 1: Actually decent. Really pretty and not annoying, and doesn't call themselves vScO. They have all of the VscO giRl items, like scrunchies, a hydroflask, a [kanken] backpack, shell necklaces, oversized shirts, friendship bracelets, crocs, and birkenstocks. And not because it makes them vScO, but because they like them. They will also obviously have a VSCO and probably be pretty chill. Bonus points if they have sleepovers on their trampoline or something and have a jeep but also aren't annoying about it.
	
	Type 2: [Demon spawn]. They will have ALL of the vSco gIrl items, and call themselves vScO quEeNs. I know girls like this. It's scary. But, VSCO is not an adjective.

Maybe they'll know [house of gold], but if they do twenty one pilots will always do it better. I really do not like these girls.

VSYNC
	(2011-08-22 +194/-22)
	VSYNC (or V-sync) is shortform for Vertical synchronization.
	
	In video games, if you rapidly turn around, you will experience a phenomenon called 'screen tearing'.
	
	Imagine a pole in the game, and if you turn quickly, instead of the entire pole moving past your field of view, only the lower or upper half moves, while the other half stays there for a split second, and then moves away as well.
	
	This phenomenon is caused if your [graphic card] is working faster than the refresh rate of your monitor.
	
	Turning VSYNC on tells the graphic card to not produce updated imagery (frames) any faster than your [monitor's] screen rate (usually 60 - [75Hz]; 120 Hz if you're a rich kid or still have a CRT, lol)
	
	...thereby "dropping" the frames down to whatever your monitor's maximum display rate is, eliminating the [screen tearing].
		Example: Yo this [screen] [tearin's] making me crazy dawg, better [turn on] the VSYNC.

	(2004-03-24 +446/-333)
	A term for [Honda's] valve timing system on most of their cars. Unfortunatly, it does not kick in until higher [RPMs], thereby essetially doing nothing for acceleration. It's a poor excuse for losers [in drag] races.
		Example: I forgot to [turn on] my [VTEC]. *[switches] on foglights*

	(2005-07-13 +148/-166)
	[lets] have more [haters] in here [not knowing] what they are talking about.
		Example: my [HEMI] got pwned by a [K20A] [I-VTEC] turbo.

	(2006-12-01 +86/-98)
	[VTEC] is a loose [acro] for Variable Valve Timing and Electronic Lift Control.
	
	VTEC is a system which optimizes the power output and fuel consumption of a motor. Some VTEC models were built towards fuel economy , while others were for performance.
	
	VTEC is engaged at all times. It enhances the engines low torque torque by enabling a cam for low [rpm] torque duty. Then crosses over to a high rpm cam profile which takes advantage of the high rpm and optimizes the power there. This in turn creates two [motors] in one , Honda has used this engineering along with lower powered 4cyl motors to create fuel efficient motors that produce [power levels] of V6 motors , with a more [peppier] , rev happy and refined feel.
	
	It takes about .1-.01 seconds for VTEC to engage to the higher rpm cam mode. A big misconception with VTEC is that it kicks in at only one point. This is wrong , it is on all the time. Its setup to give a little surge when going into it for a number of reasons, this is why most tend to believe it only comes on at higher rpm or have VTEC [off and on]. It is always active at low and high rpm. The main reason it is so effective.
	
	To take into consideration a 5.0 8cyl 93 mustang vs a 2.[2l] 4cyl prelude will beat the mustang at low and high speeds. This is due to the [optimized] system and low vehicle weight. This is the basis for all of [honda's] vehicles. Which provides a cleaner environment and has lower costs to operate. More info can be found on VTEC systems @ [superhonda].com
		Example: [VTEC] provides an [optimized] cam profile for the desired [rpm].

	(2005-01-18 +75/-119)
	The whole idea of a [VTEC] Engine is to have 2 engines in one
	[A Smooth] Fuel Effcient engine at low [revs] for normal driving
	That turns into a Agressive Race Inspired Engine at high revs
		Example: Today [spanked] a turbo [eclipse] as soon as i hit vtec in [first gear]

	Tehraneez (from [tehran], iran)
	Ekank (we came to)

VTEC Armenians
	(2005-08-24 +58/-19)
	[VTEC] Armenians noun;plural: (You can also call them VTECs for short.) The word VTEC is a name of an engine found in a [Honda S2000], or other Honda models. But a VTEC Armenian is simply a fresh-off-the-boat, Iranian Armenian. Here in LA, all the "VTECs" would choose a fixed up Honda Civic, than choosing a [supercharged] 1967 Camaro. These types of people enjoy street racing, as if they own the road.

VTO

	VTO is an acronym for Voluntary Time Off.
	
	If your work offers this, it is as addicting as crack. To get to be one of the lucky ones to actually get VTO, you must have lightening [fast reflexes] in submitting a request for it when it is released by your company's OPs team, and know how to read the WorkForce [metrics] tables so that you may anticipate its release. First ones to put in a request, and have it pass in the system as a valid request, will earn precious time off from work. Perhaps a half an hour, perhaps the entire day. Once that happens, you have [crossed over] into the obsessive/compulsion addiction; welcome to the darkside. A job without actually working (or getting paid).
		Example: "I was stalking VTO like a ninja when I couldn't stand it any longer. [It'd] been hours since I had peed. I -ran- to the bathroom, and -flew- back to my station.

	(2013-11-14 +204/-206)
	A person who loves art, music, movies, and dance, and all forms of culture so much that they consume whatever they find, whether or not it's any good. Like birds that scavenge by the roadside, culture-vultures feast on art wherever they find it. They will listen [to Mozart] in the concert hall or the punk in a club; their clothes are as likely to come from the thrift store as they are a boutique shop; they have Architecture Digest on the coffee table while they watch [MTV Cribs]. They consult the Oxford English Dictionary but double-check the Urban Dictionary. Culture vultures are especially good at talking about [low art] and culture with the same insight and intelligence as [high art].
		Example: While I have always preferred the later symphonies of Beethoven to that infernal racket they play across the hall, when Liz came over, she explained that Beethoven was "giving the finger to the man" just like punk. It wasn't my first clue that she was a culture-vulture. On our second date, she wanted to show me some graffiti across the street from the museum where we saw the [Surrealist] drawings. We stopped to get a hot dog but she insisted on putting her own [Dijon] mustard on it, which she pulled out of her knockoff Gucci bag as though it were no big deal. [Culture vulture], indeed!

VW
	(2006-01-06 +421/-173)

Their first vehicle was the Volkswagen (german for "People's Car". Thus the company name) a.k.a. K√§fer (Beetle). These small cars revolutionized the auto industry as people could afford a small-yet-reliable car. VW also produced the notoriously reliable Bus in the 1960s and 70s. After unsuccesful years between the 1970's and the early 1990's -- with the exception of the Golf, which is [the Beetle] successor -- they had difficulty with their models. Yet, they have definitely succeeded from then on and became one of the most successful automakers of all time, also owning many other brands as Audi, Seat, [Skoda], Bentley, Lamborghini.
	VW continues to have the best car colors, a stellar safety record, and are now one of the most "cutting-through" automakers in Europe, having practically all the automobile market classes covered, from the small city-car [Lupo] to the the luxurious Top-class [Phaeton]. The Golf is still their most infamous and successful model having sold over 23 million units worldwide since 1974.

	An extremely potent organophosphate nerve agent. It was discovered by the British shortly after WWII and was promptly [weaponized] by most major powers. VX has the colour and consistency of motor oil. As with all [nerve agents], VX blocks the function of [acetylcholinesterase] in the synapses, leading to recurring muscle spasms and eventually death by suffocation. Death can occur within 15 minutes of contact, either with skin or by inhalation/ingestion. VX is so lethal that a drop the size of [Lincoln's] eye on the reverse of an American penny is enough to kill an adult through skin contact. It is a persistent agent, therefore contaminated areas will remain contaminated for weeks or even months. It is difficult to destroy, since it is resistant to high temperatures and water will only increase the spread of contamination. These characteristics present an extremely acute cross-contamination hazard. If contact with VX occurs, seek medical attention IMMEDIATELY. To quote Nicholas Cage: "It's one of those things we wish we could dis-invent."
		Example: I'm [picking up] [traces] of VX, only a few parts per [billion], but it's definitely here.

Vyvanse
	(2019-05-20 +67/-9)
	A stimulant used to treat B.[E.D]. and [A.D.H.D]. that can last for up to 14 hours. When taken in higher doses can cause euphoria, extreme focus, alertness, energy/insomnia, and increase/decrease in anxiety and confidence. Can cause the feeling of 'butterfly's' in the stomach and other parts of the lower body. For some people, it can cause the need to be organized and neat (I'm typing this [on 100] mg of Vyvanse). In comparison to another commonly abused amphetamine stimulant, Adderall, [the ups] and downs of the drug may not be so distinct/sudden.
		Example: [Druggie] 1: [Eyo], I got that Vyvanse!
		Druggie 2: For real? its midnight. how we [gon] sleep?
		Druggie 1: Oh yeah...
		Druggie 2: I'll have some anyway.

	(2019-02-19 +51/-16)
	A medicine mainly [prescribed] to people with [ADHD] to help them focus. Helps some, does nothing to some, and is straight up [suicide fuel] for some.
		Example: Vyvanse didn't [help me]. Almost [killed] myself [on it].

	[Vyvanse] is an [amphetamine] pill that seems to take the game to a whole 'nother level. Unlike other amphetamine pills like [adderall] that have distinct ups and downs, and relatively quick effects, Vyvanse is like a [big slow] moving amphetamine truck that hits you all day long. It constantly hits you with the maximum dose that an equivalant dose of adderall would only reach occassionally, due to the complex structure of the amphetamine in this pill, which your body can only process so fast.
	In some ways, the effects of this pill for those who have trouble with amphetamines are worse. The consistency has a tendency to make you feel a little out of touch, it can become hard to recognize after a few hours that what you're feeling is not normal. However, it definetly still has an advantage over adderall when it's perscribed, since it cannot be snorted, making over the top abuse a little more restricted.
	Personally, I would rather have a bottle of 30 70mg [vyvanse] than a bottle of 30 30mg adderall. However, they truly are best used only once daily, with occassional break periods such as the weekend to regain your [composure]. [Amphetamine] abuse is very risky and damaging, whether a user wishes to admit it or not, and you should only take Vyvanse as prescribed by your doctor.
		Example: "I took ten [vyvanse] last night, and today i actually felt like [bob dylan]."
		
		chick- "what the hell is wrong with that creep? he must be on fucking meth or some shit."
		other chick "nah, he probably just took a bunch of [adderall] or vyvanse like a pussy"

	vyvanse (lisdexamfetamine) is a potent central nervous system stimulant prescribed to treat adhd.  people who take it usually feel more focused, work harder and faster, potentially euphoric, and more confident.  effects of vyvanse are very similar to adderall.
	  
	both drugs have a very high potential for abuse.  although adderall is the iconic speed-in-a-pill, vyvanse has an advantage due to its easily opened shell containing the drug already in a fine, easily snorted powder(intended purpose is to dissolve in water).  a burning sensation in the nose may follow, but will more than likely pass within minutes.  [this is important] because adderall can be a real pain [cutting up] [fine enough] to snort. people like to snort these drugs because it causes the drug to kick in much faster and harder, but the duration will be shortened.  avoid [fruit juice] and vitamin c when taking because it can cause your body to absorb less of the drug.
	
	there are plenty of reasons for caution when doing this drug but the broadest category to keep in mind is any problem related to the heart ([high/low] blood pressure, hardened arteries, heart attacks,irregular heartbeat, ect.)
		Example: [bovice] said [adderall] was better till he watched me snort 50 mg of vyvanse before he could cut his pill in half. owned.
		
		i used to hate 18th century french ecocritical literature, but now the only thing that makes the bugs stop crawling underneath my skin is "Les R√™veries du promeneur [solitaire]" on audio tape. thank you vyvanse!!

Vyvyan
	(2010-03-29 +50/-52)
	(n.) one of the most beautiful names a boy can have.
	
	Because it ends with a gentle flow when you pronounce it, it has an elegant and graceful twist to the name. It is also special because Vyvyan is not as common as other names. Unlike some names that make a boy sound like a [total tosser], like Stuart, Gareth, Bob, sean, Dave or James, Vyvyan sounds graceful and elegantly classy. Parents who name their boys Vyvyan have [refined taste]. It is more likely a name for the upper-class.
	
	Any boy with this name is very likely to be gorgeous with an amazing personality. The name has a sense of beauty with a drop of danger and adventure and fun to it. It is derived from the Latin meaning "life".
	
	Pretty much any name that ends with a consonant followed by -ian has a beautiful ring to it, like Lillian, [Hadrian], Julian, etc.
	
	Hands down the best kisser ever. if you're lucky enough to experience this pure ecstasy, you're going [straight to hell] because he's sinfully good.
		Example: How can anyone forget the girl named [Vivian]?
		
		Man, that Vivian is a beautiful girl!
		
		I wish I have a girlfriend named Vivian. She would be gorgeous and lots of fun.
		
		Man, that Vyvyan is so fun to be around, not to mention he's gorgeous too!
		
		Damn I wish I can kiss Vyvyan, or at least get a [warm hug] from him.
		
		What's your name? Vyvyan? That's a gorgeous name!
		
		[No boy] can be compared to a boy named Vivian.

vZombies
	(2009-10-06 +152/-29)
	The long awaited, ultra-cool term to [once and for all] end the strife between hardcore zombie fanatics over the common misconception of zombies in our popular culture. vZombies are [virally] infected humans know for their hyper-adrenal state which manifests itself in super human strength, speed, and endurance. vZombies are not to be confused with traditional Zombies, the Undead, who's strength lies in it's numbers. Zombies must be [shot in the head] to be "killed".
		Example: Dude 1: Dude! What did you think about "[Zombieland]"?
		
		Dude 2: It totally rocked! [Woody Harrelson] was a total badass, but I had to turn of my bitch meter.
		
		Dude 3: Bitch meter?
		
		Dude 2: Yeah, because technically they weren't zombies...they were people infected with a virus.
		
		Dude 1: You mean they were [the infected]?
		
		Dude 3: No, infected is too lame. We need to come up with a much more kick ass term.
		
		Dude 2: What about vZombies? Like viral zombies?
		
		Dude 1 and 3 (in unison): Yeah, vZombies!!!
