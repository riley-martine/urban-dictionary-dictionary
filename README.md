## Data
This repo includes a snapshot of all entry names from Urban dictionary taken in April 2022. The lists are found in [`data/`](https://github.com/mattbierner/urban-dictionary-word-list/tree/master/data) and are bucketed by starting letter.

Each entry name is on it's own line in the file.

## Script
The included Python script allows you to download entries directly in case you want to update the current snapshot.
It appends all new entries to the existing files by default.

```sh
# download all entries that start with 'a', 'b', or 'c'
# and appends to existing files
$ python main.py a b c --out "{0}.data"
```

```sh
# remove old data
$ rm -r data/*
# re-download all entries
$ python main.py
```
